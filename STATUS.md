# PROJECT STATUS

**GOAL (Kamil 2026-07-19): the existing families as extended and as high
quality as possible — the dataset must be GOLD. When everything below is
done and verified, this file becomes one line: "catch up finished, ready
to generate new tasks." Nothing else belongs here.**

Rules: CONTEXT.md HOW-WE-WORK. Done work lives in docs/15 + git history.
Finding details for the current campaign: `logs/semantic_review.jsonl`
(machine) + `docs/19-gold-defect-triage.md` (hand work).

## NEXT ACTIVITIES (in order)

1. **[DONE 2026-07-22] MERGED HAND QUEUE (activities 3+4) — CLOSED.**
   All 11 rubric triage roots fixed; every docs/19 finding DONE or
   refuted with artifact evidence; 032_002 re-judged clean on its
   fixed sha (4/4/4, 4/5/5 — the errored row superseded). Full record
   in docs/15 + the commit chain. Standing lessons now in force:
   per-finding evidence checks on any sweep refutation; bugfix
   children + repair_/dialog_ copies checked on EVERY gold edit (the
   pre-push perfect sweep is the backstop); stage with git add of the
   tasks tree, never bare multi-globs.

3. **[DONE 2026-07-22] Weak-assertion tail (G2) — CLOSED, floor
   PROMOTED.** Machine phase 7/9; hand-tails 064_001 (0.82) + 071_001
   (0.67); nine repair_-dir pairs refreshed and verified both sides;
   corpus re-measure: 0 families < 0.5, sub-0.6 tail = the two 037
   anonymizer families, PROVEN at ceiling (survivors live in the
   {:fake, seed} derivation arithmetic the prompt deliberately leaves
   unspecified — S6-unpinnable). validate.exs --semantic-mutants now
   FAILS below 0.6 for non-waived non-wt families (waivers are
   recorded verdicts with evidence; bite-proven both ways) and runs
   in weekly CI off the committed ledger. The strengthen-archiving
   Task-B rider is closed-as-moot: the tool retires at the line and
   the floor gate is the standing protection.

4. **[DONE 2026-07-22] Harness style debt (G4) — CLOSED.**
   The :sys.get_state/replace_state purge ALREADY RAN 2026-07-14 (34
   applied rows in logs/rewrite_reachins.jsonl; zero reach-ins on
   disk — the old "52" counted the 102-family's DOMAIN-API get_state/2
   and derivative copies; :sys.suspend/resume uses are deliberate
   stall-testing, not reach-ins). Remaining:
   (a) DONE 2026-07-22: sleep audit CLOSED — the 38 suspicious files
   collapse to 18 unique parents (rest are wt_/repair_/dialog_
   mirrors) and EVERY sleep is a sanctioned class (bounded poll
   helpers, payload sleeps, 013-family tick-catch-up, 015-family
   real-timer waits, 023-family clock-set-then-real-sweep hybrids);
   none masks a missing clock advance. Verdict row appended to
   logs/sleep_audit_worklist2.jsonl with per-family classes;
   (b) DONE 2026-07-22: the tfim_107_002 hard fail was child _11's
   STALE GOLD still asserting the pre-widening 1ms upper tolerance
   (elapsed < 1_001_000 on a real 1s timer — a 5us overshoot under
   parallel load failed it); the parent test had already been widened
   to 1_500_000 with the jitter rationale. Gold re-carved from the
   current body (raw slice, <=98 cols), 1.0 x4;
   (c) DONE 2026-07-22: S9 evaluator timer-detection spec-scoping
   landed (content-keyed contract_text; 3 unit tests; 415 green).
   [IN FLIGHT] the gate-sha flip invalidated the semantic ledger by
   design — full re-measure riding: pid 479337, log
   logs/semantic_full3.log; when it exits, commit the refreshed
   ledger (the weekly CI floor gate depends on it being sha-current).
   Relaunch: scripts/run_detached.sh logs/semantic_full3.log elixir
   scripts/validate.exs --semantic-mutants.

5. **[ ] Prompt-register variety (G3).** Template rotation for the
   six templated shapes (deterministic, no LLM), then LLM register
   rewrites of monotone seed prompts, each with a mandatory blind
   re-screen. Wire rotation into the generator templates too.

6. **[ ] @doc prose truth on existing golds (G5).** Sweep @doc claims
   vs prompt contract; un-promised claims get prompt sentences +
   anchored tests (promise-audit machinery) or get cut. (The hand
   queue in item 2 fixes many @doc-contradiction findings — check
   what the sweep still owes after it.)

7. **[ ] Family spot-checks (G6, CONTEXT rule 8).** Structured hand
   READS of sampled families across eras/shapes, both accepted and
   rejected sides; notes ledgered.

8. **[ ] Screen depth (G9) — decide by probe.** Run 3-solve
   consistency on 10 of the ~50 keep/hard roots; if the 3-solve
   verdict diverges from the recorded single-solve verdict on ≥2 of
   10, run all 50 and update the difficulty metadata; otherwise close
   the item with the probe evidence.

9. **[ ] Extension headroom (G8) — DECIDED in scope** (the goal
   literally says "extended"; deciding by probe, not by asking).
   Probe first: 2 strong base families × 1 new variation each through
   the full loop, then the SAME instruments that found this month's
   debt (semantic_review on the new roots + a rubric spot-judge);
   acceptance = zero triage-grade findings (the docs/12 §5.5 bar).
   Pass → size and run the extension loop as the LAST activity before
   the finish line (so new mints carry every gate from the items
   above, incl. the varied register). Findings → fix the generator,
   regenerate, re-probe. Probe earliest after item 5 (G3).

10. **[ ] Finish line.** Full sweeps (perfect + fim + mutants +
    decontam), export refresh, README — then this file becomes the
    one-liner. (The docs/18 training-run handoff stays available to
    Kamil at any time; gold-first proceeds regardless.)
