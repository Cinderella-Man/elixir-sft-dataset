# Implement the missing function

Below is the complete specification of a task, followed by a working,
fully tested module that solves it — except that `init` has been
removed: every clause body is blanked to `# TODO`. Implement exactly that
function so the whole module passes the task's full test suite again.
Change nothing else — every other function, attribute, and clause must
stay exactly as shown.

## The task

Write me an Elixir module called `ParallelMap` that applies a function to a collection
in parallel while enforcing a maximum concurrency limit.

I need one public function:
- `ParallelMap.pmap(collection, func, max_concurrency)` which applies `func` to each
  element of `collection` in parallel, with at most `max_concurrency` tasks running at
  the same time. It must return results in the same order as the input collection,
  regardless of completion order.

Task crash handling: if `func` raises or the spawned task exits abnormally for a given
element, that element's result should be `{:error, reason}` — this must not affect or
cancel other in-flight tasks.

For concurrency enforcement: use a pool/semaphore approach so that at no point are more
than `max_concurrency` tasks alive simultaneously. A new task should only be spawned once
a running one has finished (or crashed).

You will also need to write a helper GenServer called `ConcurrencyCounter` in the same
file. It must expose:
- `ConcurrencyCounter.start_link(opts)` — starts the process, accepts `:name`
- `ConcurrencyCounter.increment(server)` — increments the active count, returns the new value
- `ConcurrencyCounter.decrement(server)` — decrements the active count, returns the new value
- `ConcurrencyCounter.peak(server)` — returns the highest value the counter has ever reached

`ConcurrencyCounter` is intended for use in tests to verify the concurrency limit is
actually respected at runtime — your `pmap` implementation itself does not need to use it.

Give me the complete implementation in a single file. Use only OTP and the standard
library — no external dependencies. Do not use `Task.async_stream`; implement the
scheduling logic yourself using `Task.async` / `Task.yield`.

## The module with `init` missing

```elixir
defmodule ConcurrencyCounter do
  @moduledoc """
  A GenServer that tracks an active-task count and remembers the highest
  value it has ever reached (the "peak"). Intended for use in tests to
  verify that `ParallelMap.pmap/3` never exceeds its declared concurrency
  limit at runtime.

defmodule ParallelMap do
  @moduledoc """
  Applies a function to every element of a collection in parallel while
  keeping the number of concurrently running tasks at or below
  `max_concurrency`.

  Results are always returned in the same order as the input. If the
  function raises or the spawned process exits abnormally, the corresponding
  result is `{:error, reason}`; all other in-flight tasks continue
  unaffected.

  Scheduling is implemented with `Task.async`/`Task.yield_many` over a
  sliding window of at most `max_concurrency` tasks. `Task.async` links the
  task to the caller, so exits are trapped for the duration of the run (and
  restored afterwards): a crashing task then surfaces as a harmless
  `{:exit, reason}` yield result instead of killing the caller.

  Maps `func` over `collection` in parallel, with at most `max_concurrency`
  tasks alive at any one time.
