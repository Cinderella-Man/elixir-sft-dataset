Implement the private `lcs/2` function. It takes two lists (`a_list` and `b_list`)
of ids and returns their Longest Common Subsequence as a list, in order.

Compute it with bottom-up dynamic programming rather than naive recursion.
Convert both lists to tuples (`a` and `b`) so elements can be accessed by index
in constant time, and let `n` and `m` be their sizes. Build a table keyed by
`{i, j}` positions where each entry holds the actual LCS (a list) of the suffix
of `a` starting at index `i` and the suffix of `b` starting at index `j`. Fill
the table for every `{i, j}` pair from the bottom-right corner back to `{0, 0}`
(iterate `i` from `n` down to `0` and `j` from `m` down to `0`) using these rules:

  * If `i == n` or `j == m` (one suffix is empty), the entry is `[]`.
  * If `elem(a, i) == elem(b, j)`, prepend that element onto the entry at
    `{i + 1, j + 1}`.
  * Otherwise take the longer of the "skip in new" entry at `{i, j + 1}` and the
    "skip in old" entry at `{i + 1, j}`. On a tie (equal lengths), prefer the
    "skip in new" branch (`{i, j + 1}`) so that later new-sequence elements are
    kept as anchors.

Return the entry stored at `{0, 0}`.
