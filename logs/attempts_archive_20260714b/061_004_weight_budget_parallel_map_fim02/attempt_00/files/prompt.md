Implement the private `collect_one/1` function.

`collect_one/1` receives the scheduler `state` map (with keys `:running`, `:weight`,
`:results`, plus the others) and blocks until exactly one in-flight task reports back,
then returns the updated state with that task retired.

It must `receive` and handle three kinds of messages:

1. A task-completion message `{ref, result}` where `ref` is the key of a currently
   running task (guard with `is_map_key(running, ref)`). Look up the task's
   `{mon, idx, w}` entry, cancel its monitor with `Process.demonitor(mon, [:flush])`,
   and turn `result` into an outcome: `{:ok, value}` becomes `value`, while
   `{:error, reason}` stays `{:error, reason}`. Then return the state with the task
   removed from `running`, `weight` decremented by `w`, and `results` updated so that
   index `idx` maps to the outcome.

2. A monitor `{:DOWN, mon, :process, _pid, reason}` message. Find the running entry
   whose monitor reference equals `mon`. If found, remove it from `running`, decrement
   `weight` by its `w`, and record `{:error, reason}` at its `idx`. If no running entry
   matches that monitor (it was already handled), recurse with `collect_one(state)` to
   wait for the next relevant message.

3. Any other message: ignore it and recurse with `collect_one(state)`.
