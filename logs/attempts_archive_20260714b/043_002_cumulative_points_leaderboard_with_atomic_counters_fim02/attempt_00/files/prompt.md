Implement the public `add_points/3` function. It awards `points` to `player_id` on
the given `board` and returns `{:ok, new_total}`, where `new_total` is the player's
running total after the increment is applied.

Requirements:
- `points` is an integer and may be negative (to deduct points); the function head
  should guard with `is_integer(points)`.
- A brand-new player starts from a total of `0`, then has `points` added; an existing
  player has `points` added to their current total.
- The increment MUST be a lock-free atomic operation performed at the ETS level with
  `:ets.update_counter/4`, supplying a default object of `{player_id, 0}` so that the
  row is created on demand and concurrent awards to the same player can never lose
  updates. Do not use a GenServer and do not perform a read-modify-write in Elixir.
- Return `{:ok, new_total}` using the value returned by `:ets.update_counter/4`.

```elixir
defmodule CumulativeLeaderboard do
  @moduledoc """
  A cumulative-scoring leaderboard backed by an ETS table.

  A player's score is the running SUM of every award they have received.  Because
  awards accumulate, updates use `:ets.update_counter/4`, which performs the
  increment atomically at the ETS level — concurrent awards to the same player can
  never lose updates, and no GenServer or Elixir-level read-modify-write is needed.

  ## Rank contract

  `rank/2` uses standard competition ("1224") ranking: tied players share the same
  rank and the next lower group is bumped by the full size of the tied group.
