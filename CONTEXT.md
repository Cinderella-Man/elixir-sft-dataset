# CONTEXT.md — Elixir SFT Dataset

> Deep reference for this repository. Written to let an engineer (or an agent) who
> has never opened the project understand *everything*: what it is, how it is laid
> out, how tasks are authored and scored, and what each of the ~170 tasks actually
> teaches — down to the algorithm, interface, and edge cases per task family.

> **⚠️ Post-implementation update (2026-07-01).** Two things below are now out of date:
> (1) **`tasks_multifile/` no longer exists** — its 11 tasks were merged into `tasks/` under the
> standard `a_b_c_d` naming (e.g. `016_001_paginated_list_endpoint_01`), and all are now solved.
> (2) The **evaluator was rebuilt** into `lib/eval_task/` (compiled, tested) and now auto-tests all
> three task shapes — single-file, multi-file, and **fill-in-the-middle** (previously untested).
> The **analysis score was also fixed** (it used to be a constant 1.0). See `README.md` and
> `docs/01`–`03` (esp. `docs/03` §12–13) for the current state.

> **⚠️ Post-campaign update (2026-07-09).** The corpus and harness have since grown ~20×
> through the automated generation loop (docs/04–09) and passed a full QA-audit campaign
> (docs/10). Headline deltas against the text below:
> - **Scale:** `tasks/` now holds **3,753 dirs** (~600 gradable `_01`/`wt_`/`repair_` tasks +
>   FIM/tfim derivatives), grown by `scripts/generate.exs`, not by hand.
> - **Two more shapes + repair pairs:** `wt_` (write-tests) and `tfim_` (test-FIM) derived
>   dirs, plus `repair_` bug→fix pairs minted from captured generation attempts.
> - **Toolchain is pinned** (`.tool-versions`: Elixir 1.20.2 / OTP 29); the whole corpus is
>   `Code.format_string!`-canonical and gated (`scripts/format_corpus.exs --check`, CI,
>   pre-push, and `Evaluator.autoformat/1` inside the loop).
> - **Gates beyond "green":** perfect-score raw invariants (0 failed/errored, ≥1 passed,
>   0 warnings, full analysis — `overall` hard-fails to 0.0 on zero tests or any error),
>   whole-solution + per-function raise-mutant kills, FIM mutation, flake filter with an
>   enriched ledger (`logs/flaky.jsonl` carries failing test + message), and a report-only
>   semantic-mutant tightness measurement (`--semantic-mutants`, corpus kill rate 71.4%).
> - **Prompt↔harness consistency is now verified empirically:** every `_01` passed (or is a
>   judge-confirmed hard-task keep in) a blind-solve screen — an independent solver must go
>   green from `prompt.md` alone (`logs/screen_blind.jsonl`, 250/299 green).
> - `§5`'s manual-era notes and the at-a-glance numbers are historical;
>   `scripts/validate_harnesses.sh` was removed (audit docs/10 §2.3). For current
>   operations read `README.md` + `docs/10` §7 (orientation, invariants, playbook).

## ⚠️ HOW WE WORK — HARD RULES (Kamil, 2026-07-13; these override everything else)

Reading order for every session: **this section → `STATUS.md` → `docs/14`**.
These rules exist because token exhaustion happens MANY times per 24h here, and
losing work is NEVER acceptable. Every rule below was paid for.

**1. Long-running work = detached script + session monitor. Always.**
Anything that runs longer than a minute or makes LLM calls runs as:

    scripts/run_detached.sh logs/<name>.log <command...>

(`setsid` — it survives this session dying; the transport rides token-limit
windows by sleeping 15 min per attempt, forever, by design). Then, in the
session, arm a monitor so you are told the moment it exits:

    # background shell (run_in_background), NOT a foreground wait:
    while kill -0 <PID> 2>/dev/null; do sleep 60; done; tail -20 logs/<name>.log

When the monitor fires (exit OR its own timeout), check the log + ledger and
re-arm if the process is still alive. Never a bare `nohup … &`. Never a
foreground wait. **NEVER poll with `pgrep -f "<pattern>"`** — the wait-loop's
own command line contains the pattern, so it matches itself and hangs forever
(cost ~100 minutes on 2026-07-13).

**2. Every such script is ledgered: rows in, log out.**
The script MUST (a) record every processed row/unit in a JSONL ledger under
`logs/`, keyed by content sha, so a relaunch resumes exactly where it stopped
and never redoes finished work; and (b) append its console output to its own
log file. When the monitor says "exited", the ledger + log alone must answer
"what did it do" — assume the session that launched it is already dead.

**3. NEVER use multiple subagents / parallel agent fan-outs.**
Running out of tokens mid-fan-out loses ALL their in-flight work. All work
happens in the main session plus detached, ledgered scripts (which lose
nothing when tokens run out — they wait and resume). This rule stands even if
the harness offers workflows/subagents and even for "read-only" research.

**4. `STATUS.md` is the live state, updated AS YOU GO — never at the end.**
It is the default go-to place after this file. Launching a detached job?
Write its pid + log + expected result + idempotent relaunch command into
STATUS **before doing anything else**. Finished or learned something that
changes the plan? Update STATUS immediately. Running out of tokens between
"did the work" and "wrote it down" means the work is lost to the next session.

**5. HARD RULE: `STATUS.md` contains ONLY todo / in-progress / blocked items —
NOTHING that is done.** The point of STATUS is to find all the things that
need work, at a glance. The moment something completes, move it OUT: its
record lives in git history (commit messages) and `docs/15-completed-work-log.md`.
A STATUS full of victory laps hides the actual work.

**6. Commit and push at every milestone**, staging explicit paths only (never
`git add -A` while any loop is running — it sweeps mid-run output into
unrelated commits). Assume the session dies without warning: the files alone
must let the next session pick up.

**7. Every finding is a TWO-TIER work item — always.**
Whatever you find broken, it goes on the STATUS list as **TWO EXPLICIT TASKS**:
  - **Task A — fix the existing data** (retro: a ledgered, resumable tool or a
    verified hand edit with its full cascade), AND
  - **Task B — update the generation script / add a gate** (accept-time lint,
    loop check, CI gate) so the same class can NEVER be generated again.
Each task carries its own state; the problem leaves STATUS only when BOTH are
done. A finding without its Task B is NOT done. The end goal of this project
is the highest-quality dataset possible — we do not get there by fixing
existing data, generating crap, and fixing it again. Every time we learn
something, we fix it AND apply a gate (if possible) to the generation script.
Corollaries: when a GATE is repaired, audit every ledger it ever wrote
(docs/12 §5.1.12); and key permanent ledger rows to the gate's own code so a
repaired gate auto-invalidates its old verdicts. (This generalizes docs/12
§7.3 step 3 — "wire the new check into the loop + CI first" — from rounds to
every finding.)

**8. Spot-check BOTH sides — accepted AND rejected data.**
Scripts miss things on both sides, proven repeatedly: the bugfix ACCEPT audit
caught AST-reprinted buggy modules that every behavioral gate had passed
(2026-07-12), and the REJECT audit caught 15 mintable units blocked by rotten
verdicts (2026-07-13). Standing tools: `scripts/spot_verify.sh` (accepted) +
`scripts/reverify_rejects.exs` (rejected). Any new tool that accepts or
rejects units must be spot-checked on BOTH verdict kinds before its results
are trusted.

**9. Pilot before full run.**
Before running ANY script over the full dataset: run it on a FEW records
first, review that output IN GREAT DETAIL (read the actual rows/diffs/files
it produced — not just its summary line), resolve every issue and apply every
improvement found, and only then launch the full run. Pilot findings go
through rule 7 like any other finding. Precedent: the 2026-07-12 AST-reprint
pollution was caught by a spot check only AFTER a full 900+-unit mint — a
detailed pilot review would have caught it at unit three.

**10. Solved = removed from STATUS + committed, immediately.**
The moment a STATUS item is solved: remove it from STATUS (its record moves to
`docs/15-completed-work-log.md`) and make a commit containing BOTH the
improved code and the smaller STATUS. One solved item = one commit — never
batch several solved items into a mega-commit at the end of a session.

## 1. What this project is

This repo is **not an application** — it is a **hand-built dataset + evaluation harness for
generating Elixir SFT (supervised fine-tuning) training data**. It is a benchmark suite of
self-contained Elixir coding problems. Each problem bundles:

- a natural-language **prompt** (the request you'd give an LLM),
- a reference **solution**, and
- an ExUnit **test harness** that verifies any candidate solution.

A tiny Mix project wraps the collection so that solutions can be compiled and their harnesses
run in isolated BEAM processes and scored (compilation + tests + static-analysis quality). The
`README.md` frames the whole thing as *"A framework for evaluating AI-generated Elixir code
against verified test harnesses. Each solution runs in its own BEAM process — a non-compiling
solution cannot affect any other task's evaluation."*

The dataset is deliberately **OTP/stdlib-heavy**: the large majority of tasks forbid external
dependencies and drill deep OTP idioms (GenServer, ETS, `Process.monitor`, `Task`,
`Process.send_after`, injected clocks for determinism). A minority of tasks use Phoenix/Ecto/Plug.

### At a glance

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Generate & evaluate Elixir SFT training tasks |
| Elixir / OTP | **pinned** `.tool-versions`: 1.20.2 / OTP 29 (was `~> 1.17` when written); Postgres 16+ only for DB-tagged tasks |
| Task directories in `tasks/` | **165** (each has `prompt.md` + `solution.ex`; **111** also have `test_harness.exs`) |
| Task directories in `tasks_multifile/` | **11** (7 are unsolved: prompt + harness, no solution) |
| Distinct base task ideas realized | ~57 (of a ~1000-idea backlog ≈ 6%) |
| Reference-solution LOC | ~26.8k lines across `solution*.ex` |
| Test-harness LOC | ~34.1k lines (harnesses are *larger* than solutions — verification is rigorous) |
| Prompt LOC | ~15.4k lines |
| Alternate-model solutions | **1** (`tasks/076_001_trie_01/solution_Qwen3.5-4B-Q6_K_gguf.ex`) |
| Git history | 63 commits, single author (Kamil Skowron), all hand-authored |
| External deps actually used in solutions | Jason (52×), Ecto (43×), StreamData (30×), Plug (20×), Decimal (15×), Phoenix (8×), NimbleCSV (5×); everything else pure OTP |

```

`lib/` and `config/` exist only to make `mix compile` / `mix run` work so `eval_task.exs` can load
the deps; the `ElixirBenchmark.Application` supervisor starts **no children**. There is no running
service. (Note: `test/test_helper.exs` references `ElixirBenchmark.Repo`, but **no such module is
defined anywhere** — the `:database` path is aspirational and never exercised, since `ExUnit.start`
excludes `:database` and no harness carries that tag.)

---

## 3. The `a_b_c_d` naming convention (critical)

Every directory under `tasks/` is named:

```
001_001_rate_limiter_01
 │   │       │        │
 a   b       c        d

a = task number        (the base idea, e.g. "1. Rate Limiter")
b = variation number   (01 = original problem; 02+ = a DIFFERENT problem that is a
                        meaningful spin on the base — e.g. sliding-window vs fixed-window
                        vs hierarchical vs penalty-escalation rate limiters)
c = task name          (lowercased, underscores only)
d = subtask number     (01 = full "single-shot" solution WITH a test_harness.exs;
                        02+ = "fill-in-the-middle" (FIM) subtask: prompt.md embeds the whole
                        module with ONE function's body replaced by "# TODO", and solution.ex
                        contains ONLY that one function. FIM dirs have NO test_harness.exs.)
```

Consequences you must internalize:

- **`_01` dirs are the real, complete, testable tasks.** There are 111 of them (matching the 111
  `test_harness.exs` files). The 54 non-`_01` dirs are FIM subtasks with only `prompt.md` +
  `solution.ex`.
- **Different `b` = different problem** (e.g. `001_001_rate_limiter`, `001_002_fixed_window_counter`,
  `001_003_hierarchical_limiter`, `001_004_penalty_escalation` are four separate rate-limiter
  problems, all sharing task number 1).
- The `eval_task.exs` resolver takes `<task> <variation>` (the `a` and `b` numbers) and globs
  `tasks/{a padded to 3}_{b padded to 3}_*_01/` — i.e. it always evaluates the `_01` subtask.
- `tasks_multifile/` breaks this scheme: those dirs are flat (`016_paginated_list_endpoint`), and
  the reference `solution.ex` there bundles *multiple* modules inline via `<file path="...">…</file>`
  blocks.

**Two derived task kinds (prefix-named).** Since every `_01` uniquely owns a verified
`test_harness.exs`, two more SFT framings are minted from it (deterministically, no LLM — see
`docs/06-dataset-multiplication.md`):

- **`wt_<a>_<b>_<slug>`** — *write tests for this module*: `prompt.md` embeds the module + spec →
  the completion is a harness. The dir holds `solution.ex` (the module) + `test_harness.exs` (the gold
  harness). Detected as shape `:write_test`; grades like `:single`/`:multifile`.
- **`tfim_<a>_<b>_<slug>_0d`** — *test fill-in-the-middle*: `prompt.md` embeds the module + the whole
  harness with one `test "…"` body blanked to `# TODO`; `solution.ex` is that one gold `test` block
  (no harness of its own). Detected as `:test_fim`; the harness is reconstructed and run against the
  parent `_01`'s module. Each target passed an **isolation-kill** gate at authoring (the block, run
  alone, is green and kills ≥1 raise-mutant). The prefixes are glob-safe against the digit-anchored
  `_01` enumerators, so backfill/variation/FIM counting ignores them.

---

## 4. The three file types

**`prompt.md`** — a conversational coding request ("Write me an Elixir GenServer module called
`RateLimiter` that…"). It specifies the exact public API, the algorithm, required options, edge-case
behavior, and usually ends with a hard constraint like *"Use only OTP standard library, no external
dependencies. Give me the complete module in a single file."* FIM prompts instead embed the entire
module (with the target function blanked to `# TODO`) and ask for just that function.

**`solution.ex`** — the reference implementation. Canonical solutions are heavily documented
(`@moduledoc` with ASCII tables/examples, `@doc` + `@spec` on public functions) and visibly written
to the scoring rubric (see §6). For a family's `_01` it is the whole module; for a FIM subtask it is
just the one target function. A directory may also hold `solution_<MODEL>.ex` (an alternate model's
attempt scored against the same harness — only one such file exists today, a broken Qwen3.5-4B trie).

**`test_harness.exs`** — an ExUnit file (its own `defmodule …Test do use ExUnit.Case`) that verifies
any solution against the spec. These are the ground truth. Recurring harness idioms:
- `use ExUnit.Case, async: false` for shared/named-process/ETS state (76 files) vs `async: true` for
  pure modules (45 files);
- an inline fake **`Clock`** built as an `Agent` (`now/0`, `advance/1`, `set/1`) injected via a
  `:clock` option, so time-dependent logic is fully deterministic with **no real `Process.sleep`**;
- `start_supervised!({Mod, opts})` for auto-teardown, and unique names via
  `:"name_#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}"` to avoid collisions;
- white-box assertions through `:sys.get_state/1` (to check internal maps shrank after cleanup) and
  manual `send(pid, :cleanup)` + a follow-up sync call to force deterministic sweeps;
- side-effect tracking via counting `Agent`s or the process dictionary.

---

## 5. The evaluation harness (`scripts/eval_task.exs`)

The heart of the framework. `mix run ./scripts/eval_task.exs <task> [<variation>] [<solution_file>]`
compiles one solution and runs one harness **in the current BEAM**, emitting a single JSON object.

**Argument forms** (`parse_args/1`):
- `eval_task.exs 8` → task 8, variation 001, `solution.ex`
- `eval_task.exs 8 2` → task 8, variation 002
- `eval_task.exs 8 2 solution_Qwen….ex` → evaluate an alternate solution file
- (commented-out) direct `<solution> <harness> [support]` forms

`resolve_task_args/3` pads the numbers to 3 digits and globs `tasks/{a}_{b}_*_01/`, requiring exactly
one match (else it throws "No task directory found" / "Multiple matches").

**Pipeline** (`EvalTask.main/1`):
1. `compile_solution/1` — `Code.with_diagnostics` + `Code.compile_file`, capturing warnings vs errors
   separately. A compile failure short-circuits tests.
2. `analyze_source/1` — a **regex** static-analysis pass (no AST): detects `@moduledoc`, `@spec`,
   `@doc`, line count, `max_line_length`, `lines_over_98`, public/private fn counts,
   `TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX`, pipe-chain count, and a crude `sql_injection_risk` interpolation check.
3. `run_tests/1` — starts ExUnit with a custom `EvalTask.FailureCollector` formatter (a GenServer
   backed by a named ETS `:eval_task_failures` table) that records each failed test's module,
   name, and formatted message; compiles the harness; runs it; returns pass/fail/excluded counts +
   the collected failures.
4. `compute_score/1` — see below.

**Scoring model** (`compute_score/1`):

```
overall = tests · 0.7  +  analysis · 0.2  +  compilation · 0.1     (0.0 if it doesn't compile)

compilation = max(0.0, 1.0 - warnings·0.1)          # zero-warning discipline
tests       = tests_passed / tests_total            # pure pass ratio
analysis    = min(points / 10, 1.0)  where points = sum of:
                @moduledoc present …………… 2
                @spec annotations present … 2
                @doc on public fns ………… 1
                no line > 98 chars ………… 1
                no TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX …… 1
                no SQL-injection interp. … 1
                credo clean ……………………… 2   (credo_issues hard-coded to [] → effectively free)
```

The `reasons` field explains every deduction. **This rubric is why the canonical solutions all carry
moduledocs, specs, docs, stay under 98 columns, and avoid TODOs** — the doc/spec points are cheap and
banked by default (see §7 house style). `EvalTask.FailureCollector` uses ETS white-box internally so
failures survive across the ExUnit formatter callbacks.

### `scripts/run_all.exs`
Batch driver: `elixir scripts/run_all.exs <solution_filename> [--parallel N]`. Globs
`tasks/*/test_harness.exs`, looks for `<solution_filename>` in each dir (so you can score
`solution.ex` *or* an alternate like `solution_Qwen….ex`), shells out to `eval_task.exs` per task
(sequential or in `Task.async` chunks of N), and writes `results/<task>.json`, a combined
`results/report_<ts>.json`, and a human `results/summary_<ts>.txt` with compile-rate, full-pass rate,
and average score. Tasks lacking the named solution file are reported "missing," not failed.
(`results/` is gitignored.)

### `scripts/validate_harnesses.sh` (REMOVED 2026-07-09)
Deleted per the QA audit (docs/10 §2.3): it claimed to stub referenced modules but never did,
so its `OK_NEEDS_MODULE` class whitelisted typo'd module references — misplaced trust. Its job
is covered strictly better by `validate.exs` (every harness actually RUNS against its
reference under the perfect gate).

---

## 6. The authoring pipeline (how tasks are made)

The dataset is grown by three repeatable LLM-driven workflows, each backed by a meta-prompt file and
documented step-by-step in `README.md` ("How to contribute"):

1. **Single-shot task** (`tasks/single_shot_prompt.md`): take a one-line idea from `tasks.md`, ask an
   LLM to expand it into a full prompt *and* a matching test harness (using task 1 as a template).
   Save prompt/harness in a new `{a}_001_{name}_01/` dir, run the candidate solution through
   `eval_task.exs`, fix failures by feeding the JSON report + harness back to the LLM, then commit.

2. **Variations** (`tasks/variation_prompt.md`): feed one task's three files to an LLM and ask for
   **3 meaningfully-different problem variations** (new `b` numbers), plus catalog entries for
   `tasks.md`. This is how e.g. task 1 became four rate-limiter problems.

3. **Fill-in-the-middle subtasks** (`tasks/fill_in_the_middle_prompt.md`): pick good candidate
   functions from a solved module, generate a focused prompt to implement each one, and create `_02+`
   dirs whose `prompt.md` embeds the whole module with the target function replaced by `# TODO` and
   whose `solution.ex` is just that function.

Git history mirrors this exactly: commits read "Three variations of the task N", "Three subtasks
added to task 00X_00Y", "Task NN finished", etc. — a steady hand-curation cadence.

**All three workflows are also fully automated** by `scripts/generate.exs` (code in
`lib/gen_task/**`, design in `docs/04-task-generation-loop.md`). It is a *non-agentic* loop: for
each todo idea in `tasks.md` it drives Claude Opus through a fixed procedure via the `claude -p`
CLI subprocess (subscription-backed, tools off — one completion per call), authoring the base
task, then its variations, then FIM subtasks. Each artifact is graded by shelling out to
`eval_task.exs` in an isolated OS process, repaired on failure (up to `GEN_MAX_RETRIES`), and
**gated on three checks** before promotion: it must be **green**, meet the **house style**
(`@moduledoc`/`@spec`/`@doc`, no TODO, zero compile warnings), and have **every public function**
killed by a `raise`-body mutant (a per-function mutation gate — a harness that tests only some of a
module's public API is rejected). The house-style and per-function gates are skippable
(`GEN_SKIP_QUALITY_GATE`, `GEN_SKIP_PER_FN_MUTATION`). It is **add-only and idempotent**: existing
tasks are never edited or deleted, `tasks.md` inserts are guarded against duplication, and a task
already on disk is skipped — and partially-derived ideas are **topped up** (missing variations /
FIM subtasks are filled on a later run, not skipped). Run it with `mix run scripts/generate.exs
[idea_number]` (see the quick reference below and the README's "Automated generation loop" section
for env knobs); groups 065–131 were produced this way. Design + an audit of the loop's quality/yield
are in `docs/04-task-generation-loop.md` and `docs/05-generation-loop-audit.md`.

## Cross-Cutting Conventions & House Style

**Solution files are single-file, self-contained, stdlib-only modules.** Every `solution.ex` defines exactly one top-level module (`CircuitBreaker`, `LRUCache`, `Trie`, `TOTP`) with zero external deps — TOTP explicitly states "Uses only Erlang/OTP and Elixir standard libraries — no external dependencies" (`100_.../solution.ex:8`) and reaches only for `:crypto`, `Bitwise`, `URI`, `Integer`, `String`. OTP primitives come from `use GenServer` (`002`, `041`) or pure functional data (`076` `defstruct`, Saga's fluent builder). No `Application`/`Mix` scaffolding inside solution files.

**Documentation is mandatory and rubric-shaped.** Every canonical solution opens with a `@moduledoc """..."""` (often with ASCII tables — `041/solution.ex:9-13` — state diagrams, and `## Example`/`## Options` sections), every public function has `@doc`, and every public function has a `@spec`. Types are declared with `@type` (`@type name :: GenServer.name()` in `002:19`; `@type state :: %{...}` in `041:68`; `@type t :: %__MODULE__{...}` in `076:19`). Private helpers get `@spec` too (`041:217`, `041:223`). Module bodies are visually sectioned with `# ---` banner comments (`Public API`, `GenServer callbacks`, `Helpers`).

**Determinism via injected clocks / monotonic counters — never wall-clock in hot paths.** CircuitBreaker takes `:clock` as an injectable zero-arity fn defaulting to `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)` (`002:30-31,74`), stored in state and called as `state.clock.()` (`002:126,177`). LRUCache deliberately avoids clocks entirely, using a monotonic integer `counter` in GenServer state ("never a wall-clock value – so the cache is fully deterministic and testable without any clock mocking", `041:14-17`). TOTP threads time as an explicit `time \\ :os.system_time(:second)` argument (`100:36,59`) so tests can pin timestamps. This injection is the single biggest testability convention.

**Error shapes are tagged tuples; validation is defensive.** Returns are `{:ok, value}` / `{:error, reason}` / bare sentinels like `:miss` (`041:99`) or `:ok`. CircuitBreaker's `execute/1` wraps user funcs in `try/rescue` and normalizes every outcome into `{result, success?}`, converting non-conforming returns to `{:error, {:unexpected_return, other}}` and exceptions to `{:error, exception}` (`002:156-172`) so the GenServer never crashes. Guards gate public entry points: `when is_function(func, 0)` (`002:46`), `when is_binary(word)` on every Trie op (`076:37,67,92,134`), `when is_binary(code)`/`is_integer(code)` in TOTP. Invalid config raises `ArgumentError` early (`041:142-144` max_size; `100:153` bad base32). Struct-pattern function heads (`%__MODULE__{root: root}`) enforce shape at the boundary.

**OTP idioms.** `start_link(opts)` fetches a required `:name` via `Keyword.fetch!` and registers with `name: name` (`002:34-36`, `041:90-92`); optional config via `Keyword.get(opts, k, default)`. State is a plain map built in `init/1`. `@impl true`/`@impl GenServer` annotate callbacks. LRUCache demonstrates the ETS idiom fully: owner GenServer creates named `:set` (`:public, read_concurrency: true`) + `:ordered_set` (`:protected`) tables, allows lock-free direct `:ets.lookup` reads from callers, but serializes all mutations (`:touch`, `:put`, eviction) through `GenServer.call` (`041:105-115,172-210`), plus an explicit `child_spec/0` (`041:47-57`).

**Test-harness conventions.** Every harness is `use ExUnit.Case` with `async: false` when there's shared/named process or ETS state (`002:2`, `041:2`) and `async: true` for pure modules (`076:2`, `070:2`). Fake clocks are built as inline `defmodule Clock do use Agent` with `now/0`, `advance/ms` (`002:5-10`), wired in via `clock: &Clock.now/0`. Processes are started with `start_supervised!({Mod, opts})` for auto-teardown (`002:26`, `041:7`), and name collisions are dodged with `:"lru_#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}"` (`041:6`). Time is advanced by mutating the fake clock (`Clock.advance(5_000)`), never `Process.sleep` / real timers — fully deterministic. Side-effects are observed white-box without extra infra: counting `Agent`s (`002:18-23,110`) or the process dictionary via `track/tracked` helpers (`070:9-14`). No external test deps; assertions use pattern-matching (`assert {:ok, x} = ...`, `assert {:error, :b, :boom, _} = result`). (Note: none of these four harnesses actually call `:sys.get_state`; they assert through the public API — `CircuitBreaker.state/1` — rather than peeking at raw GenServer state, though `eval_task`'s own FailureCollector uses ETS white-box internally.)

**Scoring model (`scripts/eval_task.exs`) the style optimizes for.** `compute_score/1` (`:394`) weights **overall = tests·0.7 + analysis·0.2 + compilation·0.1**, and is hard-zeroed if the solution doesn't compile. Compilation score = `1.0 - warnings·0.1` (`:396-398`) — hence the zero-warning discipline. Tests score = `tests_passed / tests_total` pass ratio (`:402-404`). Analysis (`analyze_source/1:359`, `analysis_checks/1:379`) is a 10-point regex scan normalized to 1.0: `@moduledoc` present (2), `@spec ` present (2), `@doc ` present (1), zero lines >98 chars (1), zero `TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX` (1), no SQL-injection interpolation `~r/".*#{...}.*FROM|WHERE.*#{/` (1), credo clean (2, stubbed to `credo_issues: []` so effectively free). The canonical solutions visibly target exactly this rubric: every one carries `@moduledoc`+`@spec`+`@doc`, stays under 98 columns, and avoids TODOs — the moduledoc tables and `# ---` section banners cost nothing while banking the 5 doc/spec points. `analysis_score` is capped at 1.0, so the credo stub gives slack.

**Alternate-solution mechanism.** `solution.ex` is the canonical reference; other models' attempts live beside it as `solution_<MODEL>.ex`, the filename encoding the model — e.g. `076_.../solution_Qwen3.5-4B-Q6_K_gguf.ex` (model `Qwen3.5-4B-Q6_K_gguf`). `run_all.exs` takes the solution filename as a positional arg (`elixir scripts/run_all.exs solution_Qwen3.5-4B-Q6_K_gguf.ex`), globs `tasks/*/test_harness.exs`, and scores whichever `<solution_filename>` it finds in each dir against the *same* fixed `test_harness.exs` (`run_all.exs:113-130,166-183`); `eval_task.exs` also accepts `<task> <variation> <solution_file>` (`:168`). Tasks missing that filename are reported as "missing," not failed. The Qwen alternate is a clear negative example of the house style: **no `@moduledoc`, no `@spec`, no `@doc` on the public fns** (only bare descriptive `@doc` strings, and its `@type` uses undefined `char`), and it's functionally broken — `insert/delete` misuse `Enum.reduce` over graphemes while ignoring the accumulator (`solution_Qwen...:20-32`), `delete_char` has an unreachable `cond`-in-pipe and references undefined `trie`/`char.children`, so it would fail compilation/tests and score near zero — illustrating precisely the conventions the canonical solutions encode.

Key files: `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/002_001_circuit_breaker_01/{solution.ex,test_harness.exs}`, `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/041_001_lru_cache_backed_by_ets_01/{solution.ex,test_harness.exs}`, `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/076_001_trie_01/{solution.ex,test_harness.exs,solution_Qwen3.5-4B-Q6_K_gguf.ex}`, `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/100_001_totp_time_based_one_time_password_implementation_01/solution.ex`, `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/070_001_saga_compensating_transaction_coordinator_01/test_harness.exs`, `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/scripts/{eval_task.exs,run_all.exs}`.

## The Master Idea Catalogs (tasks.md & tasks_external.md)

These two files are the project's design backlog — flat markdown enumerations of task *ideas*, not implementations. Together they define a single global catalog numbered **1–1000**, partitioned by dependency profile: `tasks.md` holds the pure-stdlib/OTP ideas, `tasks_external.md` holds everything needing a library. The two files never overlap in ID space (558 numbered ideas in the pure file + 442 in the external file = exactly 1000), and they interleave — e.g. IDs 1–15 are pure, 16–30 are external, 31 pure, 32 external, and so on.

### File-level counts

| | tasks.md (pure) | tasks_external.md (external) |
|---|---|---|
| `##` category sections | 60 | 39 |
| `###` headings total | 733 | 461 |
| — numbered base ideas `### N. Name` | 558 (IDs 1–998) | 442 (IDs 16–1000) |
| — variation entries `### Task N - V…` | 48 | 3 |
| — descriptive sub-labels (non-idea) | 127 | 16 |

### The numbering scheme

1. **Base ideas** are `### N. Descriptive Name`, sharing one contiguous 1–1000 space across both files. Each is a self-contained spec paragraph (interface + required behavior + "verify by…" test criteria).
2. **Variation entries** are appended immediately after a base idea as `### Task N - V1/V2/V3 - Descriptive Name`. These are alternative-algorithm spins on a base task (e.g. task 1 "Rate Limiter" → V1 Fixed-Window, V2 Hierarchical, V3 Penalty-Escalation). Only 17 base ideas were multiplied this way: in the pure file, bases **1–13, 15, 31, 33** (16 bases × 3 = 48 variation entries); in the external file, only base **32** (3 entries). Every multiplied base has exactly 3 variations.
3. The remaining ~143 non-numbered `###` headings are structural sub-labels inside the big "Part A/B/C" mega-sections (e.g. `### Reimplementing Testing Tools`, `### LiveView-Specific Tasks`, `### 651–700: Remaining Unique Problems`), not ideas themselves.

So the two files jointly enumerate **1000 base ideas + 51 written variations ≈ 1051 idea specs.**

### Category taxonomy — tasks.md (pure, 60 `## ` sections)

The pure file is organized into families that repeat with "(Continued)" / "(Batch 2/3)" suffixes as ideas were added over time:

- **GenServer / Process-Based Tasks** — the largest early family: 57 + 9 + 5 = ~71 (rate limiters, circuit breakers, token buckets, schedulers, pub/sub, TTL/LRU caches, CRDTs, dedup/coalescers, session stores, worker pools, event sourcing, retry workers, heartbeat monitors)

- **"Reimplementing …" family** (~26 small sections: Unix/CLI, DB/Storage internals, Network Protocols, Crypto primitives, Web Framework internals, Message Queues, Observability, Data Formats, DevOps, Testing/QA, OTP patterns, Compression, etc.) — ~10 down to 1 each, ~140 total (the "Mini grep/diff/LSM-tree/WAL/HTTP-parser/HMAC/PBKDF2" 500–600 block)
- **Final Batch: Unique Daily-Dev Tasks (631–700)** — 179 headings (the single densest section)
- **Part B: Elixir Library-Specific (831–920)** — 19; **Part C: Erlang/OTP Library-Specific (921–1000)** — 91

### Category taxonomy — tasks_external.md (external, 39 `## ` sections)

- **Phoenix Endpoint / API Tasks** + **Phoenix/API (Continued)** + **(Batch 3)** — 15 + 10 + 10 = ~35 (pagination, search/filter, soft-delete CRUD, bulk create, file upload, idempotent POST, webhook receivers, long-polling, SSE, cursor pagination, ETag, sideloading)
- **Ecto / Database Tasks** + **(Continued)** + **(Batch 3)** + **Advanced Ecto** — 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 = ~30 (multi-tenancy, audit logs, polymorphic assoc, ordered lists, recursive CTEs, DB job queue, soft-delete macros, tsvector search, Ecto.Multi, advisory locks, SCD Type 2, STI)
- **LiveView / Real-time Tasks** (×2) — 5 + 5 = ~10 (debounced search, sortable/infinite tables, form wizards, PubSub feeds, Kanban, collaborative counter, presence chat)
- **Plug / Middleware Tasks** (×2) + **Middleware/Pipeline** — 5 + 5 + 2 = ~12 (request logging, validation, CORS, API-key auth, body-size limit, request-ID, compression, IP allowlist)
- **Integration / External Service Tasks** — 5 (HTTP client wrapper, email service, S3 abstraction, OAuth2, webhook delivery)
- **Telemetry / Observability** — 5; **Data Processing/ETL** (×2) — ~6; **Context/Business Logic (Batch 2)** — 4 + 10 = ~14 (polls, tagging, threaded comments, moderation queues, surveys)
- **Part A: Mini Reimplementations (301–400)** — 17 (Mini Oban, Finch, Ecto.Changeset, Plug, Phoenix.PubSub, Absinthe, Guardian, Swoosh)
- **Part B / Part B Continued (356–500)** — 47 + 77 = ~124 (Phoenix contexts, channels, LiveView components, auth flows, Ecto query patterns)
- **"Reimplementing …" family + Mini SaaS (571–630)** — ~15 (Mini Stripe/SendGrid/Twilio/Algolia/GitHub-webhook/OAuth2-server)

- **Part C: Erlang/OTP Library-Specific (921–1000)** — 39

### Implemented vs. idea-only — the realization gap

The `tasks/` directory contains **165 built variation directories** covering only **57 distinct base ideas**, all from the low end of the catalog:

- **Contiguous built ranges:** 001–015, 031–045, 061–064, 070–080
- **Sparse built:** 086, 087, 096–101, and a small high cluster 623–626 (Mini Elasticsearch / Git object store / S3 / Prometheus)

Everything else exists **only as an idea**: the entire 16–30 external-API block, 46–60 (LiveView/Ecto), 81–085 (integrations), the interior gaps 088–095, and the vast **102–622 and 627–1000 span** — including all of Part A/B/C, the "Mini X" reimplementations, the 179-entry "Final Batch," and the entire Nx/Explorer/Broadway/Absinthe library series.

**The gap is stark: 57 of ~1000 catalogued base ideas are realized (~6%), and they are almost entirely confined to IDs ≤101.** The remaining ~940 base ideas plus their would-be variations are pure backlog. Even the written variation specs outrun implementation in places (e.g. base task 14 has three built variation dirs but no `Task 14 - V` idea entries, and conversely the vast majority of the catalog's ideas have no directory at all). These two files are best understood as a ~1000-idea master roadmap of which only the first slice has been turned into actual SFT training tasks.

Key paths: `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/tasks.md`, `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/tasks_external.md`, implemented tasks under `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/NNN_*/`.

## Task families in detail

The remainder of this document catalogs every implemented task family — its exact interface, the
algorithm/data structures and OTP constructs it uses, the invariants its harness enforces, and any
noteworthy detail. Families are grouped by task-number range. Within each `_01` dir the three-file
triplet (`prompt.md` / `solution.ex` / `test_harness.exs`) is the authority.

Coverage map of what is implemented:

| Range | Theme |
|---|---|
| 001–015 | OTP process-based: rate limiters, circuit breakers, token buckets, schedulers, event buses, caches, streaming stats, CRDTs, coalescers, stores, worker pools, event sourcing, retry workers, priority queues, monitors |
| 031–034 | Data import, Ecto ingestion, log/file analysis, reconciliation |
| 035–045 | Pure data transforms + ETS-backed modules |
| 061–064 | Hand-rolled concurrency primitives |
| 070–075 | Saga + testing/utility infrastructure |
| 076–080 | Classic functional data structures |
| 086–101 | Business logic + application security |
| 623–626 | Mini clones of real systems (Elasticsearch/Git/S3/Prometheus) |
| 016–025, 102 | `tasks_multifile/`: whole-app Phoenix/Ecto/Plug/OTP features |

## Group 001 — Rate Limiters

Four independent per-key rate-limiting `GenServer` modules of escalating sophistication, all built on the same skeleton: OTP-only (no deps), an injectable `:clock` zero-arity fn (default `fn -> System.monotonic_time(:millisecond) end`) for deterministic testing, optional `:name` registration, and a self-rescheduling memory-reclamation sweep via `Process.send_after(self(), :cleanup, interval)` gated by `:cleanup_interval_ms` (default `60_000`, tests pass `:infinity` to disable and drive `:cleanup` manually with `send/2`). Every `check/*` returns `{:ok, remaining}` on admit or an `{:error, ...}` tuple carrying a `retry_after_ms` on reject, and every family enforces strict per-key independence. All four test harnesses share an identical `Clock` Agent helper (`now/0`, `advance/1`, `set/1`) started via `start_supervised!({Clock, 0})`, and probe internal state with `:sys.get_state/1`. Each family is the "original" problem only (no alternative problem variations); the trailing directory number is a fill-in-the-middle subtask index (`_01` = full module + `test_harness.exs`; `_02+` = single-function FIM with only prompt.md + solution.ex).

### 001_001_rate_limiter — Sliding Window Rate Limiter
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (opts: `:name`, `:clock`, `:cleanup_interval_ms`); `check(server, key, max_requests, window_ms)` with guard `is_integer(max_requests) and max_requests > 0 and is_integer(window_ms) and window_ms > 0`. Returns `{:ok, remaining}` or `{:error, :rate_limited, retry_after_ms}`.
- **Approach**: `GenServer` state `%{keys: %{key => {[timestamp], window_ms}}, clock, cleanup_interval_ms}`. Timestamps stored newest-first (prepend `[now | active]`). On each check, prune via `Enum.filter(timestamps, fn ts -> ts > now - window_ms end)`; admit iff `length(active) < max_requests`; `remaining = max_requests - count - 1`. On reject `retry_after = max(List.last(active) + window_ms - now, 1)` (oldest entry's expiry). Pruned list is persisted even on reject (`put_in(state.keys[key], ...)`).
- **Key invariants tested**: true sliding boundary (3/1000ms exhausted, one slot frees at t=1001 as the t=0 entry expires while t=400/t=800 still block); `retry_after` bounded `0 < r <= window` and roughly time-until-oldest-expires (~700 loose range); keys independent; `max_requests: 1`; very large window (86_400_000); cleanup drops keys whose active list empties (`map_size(state.keys) == 0`).
- **Variations**: 1 (original single-tier sliding window).
- **Subtasks**: 2 FIM — `_02` targets `handle_call({:check,...})`; `_03` targets `handle_info(:cleanup,...)`.
- **Notable**: `schedule_cleanup(:infinity)` is a no-op clause (test hook). Catch-all `handle_info(_msg, state)` prevents crashes. Uses `Enum.filter` (order-independent) rather than `take_while`.

### 001_002_fixed_window_counter — Fixed-Window Counter
- **Interface**: identical shape — `start_link(opts)`; `check(server, key, max_requests, window_ms)` (same guards). Returns `{:ok, remaining}` or `{:error, :rate_limited, retry_after_ms}`.
- **Approach**: absolute discrete windows via `window_index = div(now, window_ms)`, `window_end = (window_index+1)*window_ms`. State `%{counters: %{{key, window_index} => {count, window_end}}, ...}` — O(1) state per active window. Admit iff `count < max_requests`; `remaining = max_requests - new_count`; reject `retry_after = max(window_end - now, 1)` (time to window boundary).
- **Key invariants tested**: abrupt reset at boundary (t=999 fills window 0, t=1000 gives full fresh allowance → the intentional 2×burst across the boundary is asserted as acceptable); mid-window requests don't reset; `retry_after == 700` asserted **exactly** (not a range, unlike sliding); cleanup removes counters with `window_end <= now`.
- **Variations**: 1 (original).
- **Subtasks**: 2 FIM — `_02` targets `handle_call({:check,...})`; `_03` targets `handle_info(:cleanup,...)`.
- **Notable**: prompt explicitly documents and *sanctions* the boundary-burst weakness ("do not try to smooth it out"); moduledoc calls out `2 * max_requests` worst case. Reject path does not mutate state (no counter row created on miss).

### 001_003_hierarchical_limiter — Multi-Tier Sliding Limiter
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)`; `check(server, key, tiers)` where `tiers` is a non-empty list of `{tier_name :: atom, max_requests, window_ms}`. `validate_tiers!/1` raises `ArgumentError` on malformed tuples. Returns `{:ok, remaining_by_tier}` (map `%{tier_name => remaining}`) or `{:error, :rate_limited, tier_name, retry_after_ms}`.
- **Approach**: single shared per-key timestamp list evaluated against every tier (state `%{keys: %{key => {[ts_newest_first], widest_window_seen}}}`). `widest_window = Enum.max(windows)`; lazily prune with `Enum.take_while(ts, & &1 > now - widest_window)` (relies on newest-first sorted order). `evaluate_tiers/3` counts in-window entries per tier via nested `take_while`; if all pass, records `[now | active]` and builds remaining map (`max - count - 1` per tier); if any fail, records NO timestamp (rejected requests consume no budget) and reports the **tightest** = `Enum.max_by` on longest `retry_after` among failing tiers.
- **Key invariants tested**: single-tier ≡ plain sliding window; request admitted only if every tier has capacity; inner tier (per_sec) can reject while outer has headroom and vice-versa (per_min binding across bursts); rejections don't consume budget (10 rejects then per_min shows only 2 used); when both saturate, reports the longer-wait tier (`:per_min`, `1_000 < r <= 60_000`); three-tier real-world stack (10/s, 100/min, 1000/hr); cleanup prunes to widest window and drops emptied keys.
- **Variations**: 1 (original).
- **Subtasks**: 3 FIM — `_02` targets `handle_call({:check,...})`; `_03` targets `handle_info(:cleanup,...)`; `_04` targets the private `evaluate_tiers/3`.
- **Notable**: "tightest" is deliberately defined as *longest* retry_after (the wait the caller actually faces), not the strictest tier — subtle and explicitly tested. Correctness of `take_while` pruning depends on the monotonic-clock newest-first ordering invariant.

### 001_004_penalty_escalation — Escalating-Cooldown Limiter
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)`; `check(server, key, max_requests, window_ms, penalty_ladder)` where `penalty_ladder` is a non-empty list of positive-int cooldown ms indexed by strike count (entries validated, raise `ArgumentError` otherwise). Three outcomes: `{:ok, remaining}`; `{:error, :rate_limited, retry_after_ms, strike_count}` (limit exceeded, strike recorded); `{:error, :cooling_down, retry_after_ms, strike_count}` (active cooldown, no new strike — retries don't compound).
- **Approach**: per-key entry map `%{timestamps, strikes, last_strike_at, cooldown_end}` (`empty_entry/0`). Check flow: (1) `decay_strikes/3` — forgive `div(now - last_strike_at, window_ms*10)` strikes, `window_ms*10` = hardcoded decay period; if forgiven ≥ strikes reset to `empty_entry()`, else subtract and advance `last_strike_at`, clearing stale `cooldown_end`; (2) expire cooldown if `cooldown_end <= now`; (3) if cooldown still active → `:cooling_down`; else `evaluate_window/7` runs the sliding-window check. On reject: `new_strikes = strikes+1`, `cooldown_ms = ladder_value(ladder, new_strikes)` (`ladder_value` clamps index at `length(ladder)-1`), `retry_after = max(max(window_retry, cooldown_ms), 1)`, store `cooldown_end = now + retry_after`, do NOT add `now` to timestamps.
- **Key invariants tested**: strike recorded on first reject (returns count `1`, `retry_after >= 1_000` first-ladder rung); `:cooling_down` after window clears but cooldown active (`long_ladder [5_000,30_000]`, retries stay at strike 1); ladder walk 1→2→3 (`retry >= 5_000`, `>= 30_000`); ladder clamps beyond length (strike 3 reuses last `2_000`); decay after `window_ms*10` (=10_000) returns to strike 1; multi-strike decays one-at-a-time; per-key isolation; cleanup keeps entries with cooldown/strikes/timestamps.
- **Variations**: 1 (original).
- **Subtasks**: 4 FIM — `_02` targets `handle_call({:check,...})`; `_03` targets `evaluate_window/7`; `_04` targets `decay_strikes/3` (main clause; the `strikes: 0` and `last_strike_at: nil` guard clauses live in the surrounding module); `_05` targets `handle_info(:cleanup,...)`.
- **Notable**: solution is visibly the product of iterative debugging — comments carry emoji/self-referential fix notes (`# ✅ FIX: expire cooldown`, `# 🔑 clear stale cooldown`, "Fixed: Align stored state with returned value"). Suspicious cleanup line: `active = Enum.take_while(entry.timestamps, fn ts -> ts > now end)` keeps only *future* timestamps, effectively dropping all real (past) timestamps since `window_ms` is unavailable in `:cleanup`; the harness only asserts a weaker "fresh key behaves cleanly" property so it passes regardless. This is the most stateful/edge-case-heavy family in the group.

## Group 002 — Circuit Breakers

Four self-contained Elixir `GenServer` circuit-breaker tasks, each a variation on the closed/open/half-open resilience pattern but differing in the **trip-decision mechanism** (consecutive count vs. rolling error-rate vs. leaky-bucket) and **recovery model** (instant vs. progressive ladder). All share a near-identical skeleton: `start_link/1` with keyword opts, a synchronous `call(name, func)` that runs a zero-arity protected function through the breaker, `state/1`, `reset/1`, and — critically — an **injected `:clock`** (zero-arity `-> ms`, default `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)`) so tests drive time deterministically via a fake `Clock` Agent. Outcome classification is uniform everywhere: `{:ok, v}`=success; `{:error, r}`, a raised exception (caught, returned as `{:error, exception_struct}`, never crashing the server), or any other return shape = failure. No external deps; each family is one file. Each family has one original task with a `test_harness.exs` (`_01`) plus several fill-in-the-middle (FIM) subtasks (`_02+`) that blank out one private function with `# TODO`; there are **no `b`-variation problem rewrites** in this group (all dirs share `b=00X` per family, differing only by subtask number `d`).

### 002_001_circuit_breaker — Three-State Circuit Breaker (consecutive-count)
- **Interface**: `CircuitBreaker.start_link(opts)` opts `:name` (required), `:failure_threshold` (5), `:reset_timeout_ms` (30_000), `:half_open_max_probes` (1), `:clock`. `call(name, func)`, `state(name) :: :closed|:open|:half_open`, `reset(name) :: :ok`. Errors surfaced as `{:error, :circuit_open}` when open/over-probe-limit.
- **Approach**: `use GenServer`; single flat state map `%{circuit_state, failure_count, failure_threshold, reset_timeout_ms, half_open_max_probes, clock, opened_at, probe_count}`. `handle_call({:call, func}, ...)` dispatches on `circuit_state` to `handle_closed/handle_open/handle_half_open`. Helper `execute/1` (try/rescue), `trip_open/1` (sets `opened_at = clock.()`, zeroes counts), `reset_to_closed/1`. Consecutive **failure_count resets to 0 on any success** in closed; trips when `new_count >= failure_threshold`. Open→half-open is **lazy inside `handle_open`** (checks `elapsed >= reset_timeout_ms`, then delegates to `handle_half_open` letting that first call through as the probe). Note: unlike the other three families, `state/1` here does NOT lazily expire the open timer — the transition only happens on a `call`.
- **Key invariants tested**: starts closed; single failure keeps closed (threshold 3 in tests); success resets consecutive count; open rejects without invoking func (Agent counter stays 0); `Clock.advance(4_999)` stays open, `+1`=5000 lets probe through; successful probe→closed, failed probe→open with restarted timer + immediate re-block; `reset` from open→closed and from closed zeroes counter; full lifecycle closed→open→half-open→open→half-open→closed.
- **Variations**: 1 (original only).
- **Subtasks**: 4 FIM — `_02` `handle_closed/2`, `_03` `handle_open/2`, `_04` `handle_half_open/2`, `_05` `execute/1`.
- **Notable**: raise returns `{:error, exception}` (the struct itself). `execute/1` maps non-`{:ok}`/`{:error}` returns to `{:error, {:unexpected_return, other}}`. FIM prompts embed the full module with the target function replaced by `# TODO`.

### 002_002_rolling_window_error_rate_cb — Rolling-Window Error-Rate Breaker (Hystrix-style)
- **Interface**: `RollingRateCircuitBreaker.start_link(opts)` opts `:name`, `:window_size` (20), `:error_rate_threshold` float in (0.0,1.0] (0.5), `:min_calls_in_window` (10), `:reset_timeout_ms` (30_000), `:half_open_max_probes` (1), `:clock`. Same `call/state/reset` surface; `state` message key is `:get_state`.
- **Approach**: state map `%{state, outcomes, opened_at, probes_in_flight, clock, config}` where `config` is a nested map. `outcomes` is a **count-based list of `:ok|:error` atoms, newest-first, truncated via `[outcome | outcomes] |> Enum.take(window_size)`**. Trip predicate `should_trip?/2`: `total>=min_calls_in_window AND errors/total >= error_rate_threshold` (via `Enum.count(&(&1==:error))`). Distinct from family 001: uses lazy `maybe_expire_open/1` (called at top of every `{:call}` and `:get_state`) to flip open→half-open when timer elapses. **Window is wiped `[]` on every transition** (trip, probe success→closed, probe fail→open, manual reset). `execute_and_classify/1` returns `{:ok|:error, reply}`.
- **Key invariants tested**: 20 successes stay closed; 3/10 errors (30%) stays closed; exactly 3/6=50% trips; 100% error but only 5<6 min_calls stays closed then 6th trips; **strict 50/50 alternation trips** (the whole point vs. consecutive-count); rolling eviction can keep closed at 4/10 then trip at 5/10; open rejects (uses `refute_received`); open→half-open exactly at `reset_timeout_ms`; probe success→closed with empty window; probe fail→open with fully restarted timer; raise `%RuntimeError{message: "boom"}` counts, 6 raises trip; reset clears window.
- **Variations**: 1.
- **Subtasks**: 3 FIM — `_02` `should_trip?/2`, `_03` `execute_and_classify/1`, `_04` `execute_in_closed/2`.
- **Notable**: motivation explicitly cites Netflix Hystrix; `min_calls_in_window` floor prevents 1/1=100% early trip.

### 002_003_progressive_recovery_cb — Four-State Progressive-Recovery Breaker
- **Interface**: `ProgressiveRecoveryCircuitBreaker.start_link(opts)` opts `:name`, `:failure_threshold` (5), `:reset_timeout_ms` (30_000), `:half_open_max_probes` (1), `:recovery_stages` (default `[{5,0},{15,1},{30,2}]`), `:clock`. `state(name) :: :closed|:open|:half_open|:recovering`; plus `call/reset`.
- **Approach**: Adds a `:recovering` state between half-open and closed to stop flapping — a successful probe enters `:recovering` at stage 0 rather than closing immediately. State map adds `recovery_stage`, `stage_calls`, `stage_failures` (plus `failure_count`, `opened_at`, `probes_in_flight`). Closed trip logic identical to family 001 (consecutive `failure_threshold`). `recovery_stages` is a list of `{calls_required, failures_tolerated}` tuples; `execute_in_recovering/2` increments stage counters, reads limits via `Enum.at(recovery_stages, recovery_stage)`, then a `cond`: `stage_failures > tolerated`→`:open` (restart timer, reset stage to 0); `stage_calls >= required`→`advance_stage/2` (next stage w/ fresh counters, or `:closed` if final); else stay. `init` raises `ArgumentError` on empty `recovery_stages`. Lazy `maybe_expire_open/1`.
- **Key invariants tested** (test ladder `[{3,0},{5,1},{10,2}]`, threshold 3): closed passthrough; 3 consecutive failures trip; success resets consecutive count; open rejects; **probe success→`:recovering` NOT `:closed`**; clearing all three stages (3, then 5, then 10 calls) →`:closed`; 1 failure inside stage-1 tolerance stays recovering; single failure in stage-0 (zero tolerance)→`:open`; 2nd failure in stage-1→`:open`; reopen from recovering restarts reset timer; raise in recovering counts as stage failure→`:open`; reset from open/recovering zeroes all counters.
- **Variations**: 1.
- **Subtasks**: 4 FIM — `_02` `execute_in_closed/2`, `_03` `execute_in_half_open/2`, `_04` `execute_in_recovering/2`, `_05` `advance_stage/2`.
- **Notable**: `@default_recovery_stages` module attribute; ladder gives progressively more evidence at progressively higher permitted failure counts; every recovering call executes (no traffic sampling/rejection during recovery).

### 002_004_leaky_bucket_failure_cb — Leaky-Bucket Failure Breaker
- **Interface**: `LeakyBucketCircuitBreaker.start_link(opts)` opts `:name`, `:bucket_capacity` (5.0), `:leak_rate_per_sec` (1.0), `:failure_weight` (1.0), `:reset_timeout_ms` (30_000), `:half_open_max_probes` (1), `:clock`. Adds inspection API **`bucket_level(name) :: float()`** (applies pending leak before returning) on top of `call/state/reset`.
- **Approach**: Failures add `failure_weight` drops; drops leak continuously at `leak_rate_per_sec`. State map `%{state, bucket_level (float), last_update_at, opened_at, probes_in_flight, clock, config}`. Core helper `apply_leak/1`: `leak = elapsed_ms * leak_rate_per_sec / 1000; bucket_level = max(0.0, bucket_level - leak)`, advances `last_update_at` to now — applied **lazily** at start of `execute_in_closed/2` and in the `:bucket_level` handler (no periodic timer). Closed: leak first, run func, on failure add weight; trip to `:open` (and **zero bucket on trip**) when `new_level >= bucket_capacity`. `config` coerces all numeric opts to floats via `* 1.0` so integer opts work. Lazy `maybe_expire_open/1`; probe success→closed with empty bucket, resetting `last_update_at`.
- **Key invariants tested**: bucket starts 0.0; each failure +1.0; successes add nothing; leaks 3.0→2.0 after 1s, →0.0 after 3s; never below 0 even after huge idle; partial-second (500ms→0.5) leak; burst of 5 trips; 1 failure/2s outpaced by 1/s leak stays closed over 20 iters; trips on fresh burst after quiet period; intermingled successes don't reduce bucket (4 fails + ok + fail trips at 5.0); `failure_weight: 3.0` (9.0 under 10 cap, 4th=12 trips); all-integer opts coerced (`cap 3, rate 2, weight 1`); open rejects; open→half-open at timeout; probe success→closed empty bucket; probe fail→open restarted timer; 5 raises trip; reset clears bucket.
- **Variations**: 1.
- **Subtasks**: 3 FIM — `_02` `apply_leak/1`, `_03` `execute_in_closed/2`, `_04` `execute_in_half_open/2`.
- **Notable**: motivation cites Cisco-router error-rate detection; all bucket arithmetic float; two harness tests re-`start_link` extra breakers (`:weighted_cb`, `:int_cb`) reusing the single supervised `Clock` (comments note removed duplicate `start_supervised!`).

Key files (originals with harnesses): `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/002_001_circuit_breaker_01/`, `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/002_002_rolling_window_error_rate_cb_01/`, `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/002_003_progressive_recovery_cb_01/`, `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/002_004_leaky_bucket_failure_cb_01/` (each has prompt.md, solution.ex, test_harness.exs).

## Group 003 — Token Buckets

Four independent per-key rate-limiter GenServers, all sharing a common design language: keyed buckets in a `%{name => data}` map, **lazy time-based refill** computed on each call (never per-bucket timers), an **injectable `:clock`** (`(-> integer_ms)`, defaults to `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)`) for deterministic tests, a `retry_after_ms` on rejection (positive-integer ceiling), and a periodic `Process.send_after(self(), :cleanup, interval)` sweep (configurable `:cleanup_interval_ms`, default 60_000; tests pass `:infinity` to disable) that evicts buckets indistinguishable from fresh ones. Token counts are floats (fractional refill), `remaining` returned as integer floor/`trunc`. Every test file embeds an identical `Clock` Agent (`start_link`, `now/0`, `advance/1`, `set/1`) registered under `__MODULE__`, `use ExUnit.Case, async: false`, and pokes internals via `:sys.get_state/1` and `send(pid, :cleanup)`. No external deps; OTP stdlib only. Each family is a single problem (variation `001`); the `_NN` suffix is the **subtask** index, not an alt-variation — only `_01` ships a `test_harness.exs`, higher subtasks are fill-in-the-middle (prompt embeds full module with one function stubbed `# TODO`, `solution.ex` is just that function body).

### 003_001_leaky_bucket_token_dispenser — Leaky Bucket Token Dispenser

- **Interface**: `LeakyBucket.start_link(opts)` (`:clock`, `:name`, `:cleanup_interval_ms`=60_000, `:cleanup_ttl_ms`=300_000); `LeakyBucket.acquire(server, bucket_name, capacity, refill_rate, tokens \\ 1)` → `{:ok, remaining}` | `{:error, :empty, retry_after_ms}`.
- **Approach**: `use GenServer`. Nested `defstruct` modules `State{clock, cleanup_interval_ms, cleanup_ttl_ms, buckets: %{}}` and `Bucket{tokens, last_access}` (both `@enforce_keys`). Lazy refill `new = min(capacity, old + elapsed_ms*refill_rate/1000)` in private `refill/4` using `max(now-last_access, 0)`. Fresh bucket starts **full** at `capacity*1.0`. `retry_after_ms = ceil(deficit/refill_rate*1000)`, `deficit = tokens - bucket.tokens`. `extract_gen_opts/1` splits `:name` for registration. `schedule_cleanup(:infinity)` is a no-op clause.
- **Key invariants tested**: new bucket full; drain-to-zero then reject; refill proportional to elapsed time (5 tok/s → +5 after 1000ms, partial 500ms → +5 at 10/s); never exceeds capacity after huge idle; `retry_after` within ±100–200ms tolerance bands and accounts for multi-token + fractional balance; bucket independence/interleaving; `capacity 1`, high refill (1000/s capped), request > capacity always fails; cleanup drops buckets idle > `cleanup_ttl_ms` (empties `state.buckets`), keeps recently-touched. Note: rejection path still updates `last_access` (touched) so refilled tokens/eviction aren't lost.
- **Variations**: 1 (original only).
- **Subtasks**: 2 fill-in — `_02` = `handle_call({:acquire,...})`; `_03` = `handle_info(:cleanup,...)`.
- **Notable**: uses `floor/1` for `remaining` (vs `trunc/1` elsewhere in group); catch-all `handle_info(_msg, state)`.

### 003_002_gcra — GCRA / Theoretical Arrival Time

- **Interface**: `GcraLimiter.start_link(opts)` (`:clock`, `:name`, `:cleanup_interval_ms`=60_000, `:cleanup_idle_ms`=300_000); `GcraLimiter.acquire(server, bucket_name, rate_per_sec, burst_size, tokens \\ 1)` → `{:ok, remaining}` | `{:error, :rate_exceeded, retry_after_ms}`. Guard clause: `rate_per_sec` number > 0, `burst_size`/`tokens` positive integers.
- **Approach**: state is `%{buckets: %{name => tat_float}, clock, cleanup_interval_ms, cleanup_idle_ms}` — **single scalar TAT per bucket**, not `{tokens, last_refill}`. Per call: `emission_interval = 1000/rate_per_sec`; `dvt = burst*emission_interval`; `tat = Map.get(buckets, bucket, now*1.0)`; `new_tat = max(now, tat) + tokens*emission_interval`; `earliest_admit = new_tat - dvt`. Admit iff `earliest_admit <= now`, store `new_tat`, `remaining = max(trunc((dvt-(new_tat-now))/emission_interval), 0)`. Reject → **do NOT update TAT**, `retry_after = ceil_positive(earliest_admit-now)` (min 1). Cleanup drops buckets where `now - tat >= cleanup_idle_ms`.
- **Key invariants tested**: fresh bucket admits full burst back-to-back; steady-state one admit per `emission_interval` after burst; **`max(now,tat)` trap** — 10_000_000ms idle still admits only `burst` (no unbounded credit); **no-TAT-advance-on-reject trap** — 50 spam rejects then +200ms still admits one; independent TATs; multi-token deducts all / over-burst rejected without mutating TAT; `retry_after` within emission interval; fractional rates (0.5 req/s → 2000ms interval); cleanup with `cleanup_idle_ms: 1_000`.
- **Variations**: 1.
- **Subtasks**: 2 fill-in — `_02` = `handle_call({:acquire,...})` (GCRA core math); `_03` = `handle_info(:cleanup,...)`.
- **Notable**: prompt explicitly enumerates the two classic GCRA pitfalls; `ceil_positive/1` helper (trunc+bump, `max(_,1)`).

### 003_003_lease_based_bucket — Lease-Based Bucket (reserve / complete / cancel)

- **Interface**: `LeaseBucket.start_link(opts)` (`:clock`, `:name`, `:cleanup_interval_ms`=60_000); `acquire_lease(server, bucket, capacity, refill_rate, tokens, lease_timeout_ms)` → `{:ok, lease_id, remaining}` | `{:error, :empty, retry_after_ms}` (guard also enforces `tokens <= capacity`); `release(server, bucket, lease_id, outcome)` with `outcome in [:completed, :cancelled]` → `:ok` | `{:error, :unknown_lease}`; `active_leases(server, bucket)` → `{:ok, count}` (`{:ok, 0}` unknown).
- **Approach**: per-bucket map `%{free: float, capacity, refill_rate, last_update_at, leases: %{lease_id => {tokens, expires_at}}}`. `lease_id = make_ref()` (opaque `reference()`). Central `refill_and_expire(bucket, now)` applies lazy refill AND drops leases where `expires_at <= now` — **expired leases treated as `:completed`, tokens NOT refunded** (pessimistic, anti-exploit); called at the top of every acquire/release/active_leases/cleanup. `:cancelled` refunds `min(capacity, free+tokens)`; `:completed` just deletes. `acquire_lease` multiplies `refill_rate*1.0`. `get_bucket/5` lets capacity/rate be updated mid-stream. Cleanup drops buckets with `map_size(leases)==0 and free >= capacity`.
- **Key invariants tested**: reserve deducts + returns ref; over-free-balance rejected; `:cancelled` refunds (full balance restored), `:completed` keeps consumed; unknown/known-bucket-unknown-lease and double-release both `:unknown_lease`; expired lease vanishes without refund but elapsed refill still applies (2→3.5 over 1.5s); one bucket op expires *other* buckets' due leases; lazy refill + cap; multiple independent leases with mixed outcomes; cleanup drops refilled-lease-free buckets, keeps ones with long (3_600_000ms) leases.
- **Variations**: 1.
- **Subtasks**: 3 fill-in — `_02` = private `refill_and_expire/2`; `_03` = `handle_call({:acquire_lease,...})`; `_04` = `handle_call({:release,...})`.
- **Notable**: only family with a mutation API (release) and lease timeouts; `remaining` uses `trunc/1`.

### 003_004_shared_pool_bucket — Shared-Pool (Two-Level) Bucket

- **Interface**: `SharedPoolBucket.start_link(opts)` — **required** `:global_capacity` (pos int) + `:global_refill_rate` (pos number) via `Keyword.fetch!`, plus `:clock`, `:name`, `:cleanup_interval_ms`=60_000; `acquire(server, bucket_name, key_capacity, key_refill_rate, tokens \\ 1)` → `{:ok, key_remaining, global_remaining}` | `{:error, :key_empty | :global_empty, retry_after_ms}`; `global_level(server)` → `{:ok, int}`; `key_level(server, bucket_name, key_capacity, key_refill_rate)` → `{:ok, int}` (`{:ok, key_capacity}` if unseen, **without creating** the bucket).
- **Approach**: two levels — per-key buckets `%{free, capacity, refill_rate, last_update_at}` in `state.buckets`, and the **global pool at top level** (`global_free`, `global_capacity`, `global_refill_rate`, `global_last_update_at`), never in the buckets map. Both use same lazy formula; `refill_global/2` and `get_and_refill_bucket/5` applied to both **before** evaluating drain. Atomic: on reject **nothing drained from either level** (refilled state still persisted so clock stays current). Precedence via `cond`: check `bucket.free < tokens` → `:key_empty` **first** (even if global also short), then `state.global_free < tokens` → `:global_empty`, else drain both. `retry_after = ceil_positive(deficit*1000/rate)` per offending level. Cleanup projects each bucket's refill and drops those `>= capacity`; **global pool never dropped**.
- **Key invariants tested**: both levels drain on success; global drains across different keys; per-key exhaustion returns `:key_empty` and leaves global/other keys intact; rejected acquire drains nothing; global exhaustion → `:global_empty` when per-key has room (carol untouched); **both-empty precedence** (global_capacity 2) reports `:key_empty` not `:global_empty`; independent lazy refill + caps on both levels; multi-token math; `key_level` on unknown returns capacity without creating bucket; cleanup empties `buckets` but keeps global (refilled to 10).
- **Variations**: 1.
- **Subtasks**: 3 fill-in — `_02` = `handle_call({:acquire,...})` (two-level cond); `_03` = private `get_and_refill_bucket/5`; `_04` = `handle_info(:cleanup,...)`.
- **Notable**: only family that configures limits (global) at `start_link` and requires opts; per-key capacity/rate still passed per-`acquire` (not stored at creation), hence `key_level` needs them as args.

Files: full specs in `/home/car/projects/elixir-sft-dataset/tasks/003_001_leaky_bucket_token_dispenser_01/`, `.../003_002_gcra_01/`, `.../003_003_lease_based_bucket_01/`, `.../003_004_shared_pool_bucket_01/` (each `prompt.md` + `solution.ex` + `test_harness.exs`).

## Group 004 — Schedulers

Four self-contained job-scheduler `GenServer` modules, each a single-file OTP solution using only the standard library. All share an identical architectural skeleton: state is `%{jobs: %{name => job_map}, clock, tick_interval_ms}`; a zero-arity **injected `:clock`** returning `NaiveDateTime` makes time deterministic; a poll loop driven by `Process.send_after(self(), :tick, tick_interval_ms)` (default `1_000`; `:infinity` disables auto-ticking so tests drive `:tick` by hand); job MFAs are executed via `apply(mod, fun, args)` wrapped in `try/rescue/catch` so a crashing job never kills the server. They differ only in the **schedule representation and the next-run math**: cron expressions (001), fixed drift-free intervals (002), one-shot exponential-backoff retries (003), and calendar-aware rules (004). Every family's `_01` dir is the full single-shot task (has `test_harness.exs`); `_02+` dirs are fill-in-the-middle subtasks (prompt.md embeds the whole module with one private function replaced by `# TODO`, solution.ex is just that function). Tests use ExUnit `async: false`, an `Agent`-based fake `Clock` (`now/advance/set`), and either an `Agent` `JobTracker`/`Flaky` or `send(test_pid, tag)` sinks; ticks are synchronized via `send(pid, :tick); :sys.get_state(pid)`.

### 004_001 — Job Scheduler with Cron-like Expressions

- **Interface** (module `Scheduler`): `start_link(opts)` (opts `:clock`, `:name`, `:tick_interval_ms`); `register(server, name, cron_expression, {mod, fun, args})` → `:ok | {:error, :invalid_cron} | {:error, :already_exists}`; `unregister(server, name)` → `:ok | {:error, :not_found}`; `jobs(server)` → `[{name, cron_expression, next_run}]`; `next_run(server, name)` → `{:ok, ndt} | {:error, :not_found}`.
- **Approach**: 5-field cron string (minute 0–59, hour 0–23, day 1–31, month 1–12, weekday 0–6 with 0=Sunday). Parser (`parse_cron`→`parse_field`→`parse_part`→`parse_range_or_star`/`parse_range_or_value`) supports `*`, int, comma-lists, `a-b` ranges, `*/step` and `a-b/step`; each field compiled to a `MapSet` of ints (`@field_ranges`, `@field_order`). Next-run via `next_run_time`→`scan/3`: truncate seconds to 0, add 60s, then minute-by-minute forward scan with jumps (`advance_to_next_month`, `next_day`, `next_hour`) checking month→day→weekday→hour→minute in order; `@max_iterations 2_200_000` guard raises if no match. `day_of_week/1` converts Elixir's `Date.day_of_week` (Mon=1..Sun=7) so Sunday→0. On `:tick`, jobs with `next_run <= now` fire and recompute from `now`.
- **Key invariants tested**: out-of-range values rejected (minute 60, hour 25, weekday 7, too few fields); duplicate names; recurrence advances (`0 * * * *` 11:00→12:00); `*/15`→{0,15,30,45}; `10-30/10`→{10,20,30}; day-of-week scheduling (Sun→next Sunday Jan 11, Wed→Jan 7 then Jan 14); leap-year `0 0 29 2 *` skips to **2028-02-29**; no double-fire on repeated tick; two jobs same minute both fire; unregister prevents firing.
- **Subtasks** (4): `_02` `scan/3` (field-priority advance loop); `_03` `parse_part/3` (step handling); `_04` `parse_range_or_value/3` (single/range); `_05` `parse_field/3` (comma-split reduce into MapSet).
- **Notable**: step semantics keep values whose offset from the range start is divisible by step (`rem(v - start, step) == 0`), not strict modulo-0. Only family with a full standalone cron parser and minute-scan (vs. calendar math).

### 004_002 — IntervalScheduler (drift-free)

- **Interface** (module `IntervalScheduler`): same shape as 001 but `register(server, name, interval_spec, mfa)` where `interval_spec = {:every, n, unit}`, `unit ∈ :seconds|:minutes|:hours|:days`, `n` positive int → `{:error, :invalid_interval}` otherwise; `jobs` returns `{name, interval_spec, next_run}`.
- **Approach**: `parse_interval/1` converts spec to `interval_s` seconds (×60/×3600/×86400). Registration captures immutable `started_at` anchor from clock. **Drift-free** `compute_next_run(started_at, interval_s, now)`: `elapsed = NaiveDateTime.diff(now, started_at, :second); n = max(1, div(elapsed, interval_s) + 1); started_at + n*interval_s`. On `:tick`, due jobs execute and reschedule from the **anchor**, not from execution time.
- **Key invariants tested**: first fire at `t0 + interval`; late tick (t0+61s) → next is t0+120s not t0+121s (no cumulative drift); big skip (t0+250s) → exactly **one** fire, next = t0+300s (**no catch-up replay** of missed 60/120/180/240 boundaries); steady-state alignment `N = div(i*11,10)+1` over 5 ticks; unit conversions (300/7200/86400s); crashing job (`{:error,:invalid_interval}` specs `{:every,0,...}`, `{:every,-5,...}`, `:fortnights`, string spec) rejected; crashing job survives and still advances; unregister stops firing.
- **Subtasks** (2): `_02` `compute_next_run/3` (the drift-free formula); `_03` `parse_interval/1` (4 unit clauses + fallthrough).
- **Notable**: `safe_execute` returns `:crashed` on failure but return value ignored — interval jobs fire regardless of outcome (contrast 003). The entire point is anchor-relative scheduling to avoid drift and replay.

### 004_003 — RetryScheduler (backoff)

- **Interface** (module `RetryScheduler`): `start_link(opts)`; `schedule(server, name, run_at, {mod,fun,args}, opts \\ [])` where `run_at` is a `NaiveDateTime` and `opts` may set `:max_attempts` (default 3, **total** attempts incl. first), `:base_delay_ms` (default 1_000), `:backoff_factor` (default 2.0, must be ≥ 1.0) → `:ok | {:error, :already_exists} | {:error, :invalid_opts}`; `cancel(server, name)` → `:ok | {:error, :not_found}` (valid in any state, incl. terminal); `status(server, name)` → `{:ok, status, attempts_so_far} | {:error, :not_found}`, status `:pending|:completed|:dead`; `jobs(server)` → `[{name, status, next_attempt_at, attempts_so_far}]`.
- **Approach**: one-shot jobs with lifecycle `:pending → :completed` (success) or `:pending → :dead` (retries exhausted); terminal jobs retained for inspection, never re-run. On `:tick`, only `status == :pending && next_attempt_at <= now` are picked. `process_attempt/2`: increments `attempts_so_far`; success (`safe_execute` maps `:ok`/`{:ok,_}`→`:success`, everything else incl. `:error`/`{:error,_}`/weird returns/raise/throw→`:failure`) → `:completed`; failure with `attempts >= max_attempts` → `:dead`; else stay `:pending` with `next_attempt_at = now + round(base_delay_ms * backoff_factor^(attempts-1))` ms. `validate_opts` enforces integer `max_attempts ≥ 1`, integer `base_delay_ms ≥ 0`, number `backoff_factor ≥ 1.0` (coerced `* 1.0`).
- **Key invariants tested**: outcome classification (all 8 return/exception shapes); backoff geometry (1000; then 100→300→700 cumulative for factor 2; `:dead` at max_attempts); flaky "fail twice then succeed" ends `:completed` with 3 attempts; `run_at` in past fires next tick, future respected; `:dead`/`:completed` never re-execute; cancel stops retries; invalid opts (`max_attempts: 0`, `backoff_factor: 0.5`, `base_delay_ms: -1`).
- **Subtasks** (3): `_02` `process_attempt/2` (success/dead/backoff branches); `_03` `safe_execute/1` (outcome classifier); `_04` `validate_opts/1`.
- **Notable**: only non-recurring family (bounded lifecycle, terminal states). Delays are in **milliseconds** (uses `NaiveDateTime.add(now, delay_ms, :millisecond)`); test `Clock.advance_ms/1`. `schedule/5` guard requires `%NaiveDateTime{} = run_at`. Test harness `Flaky` module has an explicit `use Agent` comment noting a child_spec fix.

### 004_004 — CalendarScheduler

- **Interface** (module `CalendarScheduler`): same shape as 002 but `register(server, name, rule, mfa)` → `:ok | {:error, :invalid_rule} | {:error, :already_exists}`; `jobs` returns `{name, rule, next_run}`. Four rule tuples exactly: `{:nth_weekday_of_month, n(1..4), weekday, {h, m}}`; `{:last_weekday_of_month, weekday, {h, m}}`; `{:nth_day_of_month, day(1..31), {h, m}}`; `{:last_day_of_month, {h, m}}`. `weekday ∈ :monday..:sunday` (`@weekdays` maps to ISO 1..7), `h ∈ 0..23`, `m ∈ 0..59`.
- **Approach**: `valid_rule?/1` clauses with guards for each tuple shape. Next-run is **calendar-walking, not minute-scanning**: `compute_next_run(rule, after_ndt)` → `walk_months/5` starting at `{after.year, after.month}` with a **60-month budget** (raises if exhausted). Per month `target_in_month/3` computes the candidate: nth_weekday uses `Date.day_of_week(first_of_month)`, `days_to_first = rem(target_dow - first_dow + 7, 7)`, `nth_day = 1 + days_to_first + (n-1)*7` (`:no_match` if `> days_in_month`); last_weekday walks back from last day (`steps_back = rem(last_dow - target_dow + 7, 7)`); nth_day valid iff `day <= Calendar.ISO.days_in_month`; last_day uses `days_in_month` directly. First candidate strictly `> after_ndt` wins; else `bump_month` (Dec→Jan next year).
- **Key invariants tested**: first Monday Jan 2025 = Jan 6; second Tuesday = Jan 14; advance to next month after target passes (→ Feb 3); last Friday Jan = Jan 31; last Sunday Feb 2025 = Feb 23; 15th at noon; **`nth_day_of_month, 31` skips Feb/Apr/Jun/Sep/Nov** (Jan31→Mar31, Mar31→May31); last-day handles leap (Feb 2024 = 29th) vs non-leap (Feb 2025 = 28th); Dec→Jan year rollover; crashing job survives and advances; multiple due jobs all fire.
- **Subtasks** (3): `_02` all four `target_in_month/3` clauses (pure calendar math); `_03` `walk_months/5` (recursion + budget guard); `_04` `compute_next_run/2` (entry, budget=60).
- **Notable**: motivation is patterns cron can't express ("first Monday", "last weekday"). Uses `Calendar.ISO.days_in_month/2` and `Date.day_of_week/1` (ISO Mon=1) — no minute scan. Test anchor `~N[2025-01-01 00:00:00]` is a Wednesday.

## Group 005 — Pub/Sub Event Buses

Four independent in-process pub/sub GenServer implementations, each a variation on "subscribers register interest, publishers fan out `{:event, ...}` messages." All are single-file, OTP-stdlib-only, use `Process.monitor` for automatic dead-subscriber cleanup on `:DOWN`, register subscriptions by the monitor `ref` (which doubles as the subscription id), support the same pid subscribing multiple times (one delivery per subscription), and accept a `:name` option for process registration. They diverge on the routing axis: 001 = topic wildcards; 002 = priority-ordered serial+cancellable delivery; 003 = bounded per-topic replay history; 004 = content-based filter DSL. Only 003 injects a clock for determinism. Directory scheme here: the second number (001–004) selects the distinct task family; the trailing `_NN` is the subtask (`_01` = full solution + `test_harness.exs`; `_02+` = fill-in-the-middle, single-function `solution.ex` with the module embedded in `prompt.md` and target replaced by `# TODO`).

### 005_001_pubsub_event_bus — Wildcard Pub/Sub with Monitor Cleanup
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`); `subscribe(server, topic, pid) :: {:ok, ref}` (monitors pid, ref=monitor ref); `unsubscribe(server, topic, ref) :: :ok`; `publish(server, topic, event) :: :ok` (sends `{:event, topic, event}`). All client calls are `GenServer.call`.
- **Approach**: GenServer, three-index state `%{topics: %{pattern => %{ref => pid}}, refs: %{ref => {pid, topic}}, pids: %{pid => MapSet.t(ref)}}`. Wildcard match via `topic_matches?/2`: split both on `"."`, require equal segment count, then recursive `segments_match?/2` where `"*"` matches any one segment, literal segment must be equal. Publish iterates all patterns, `send/2` to each matching sub. `:DOWN` handler removes all of the pid's refs across topics and `Process.demonitor(r, [:flush])` the *other* refs (the fired one auto-cleans).
- **Key invariants tested**: `"orders.*"` matches exactly-one segment (not zero `"orders"`, not two `"orders.items.created"`); `"*.*"` = any two-segment; mid-pattern wildcard `"orders.*.completed"`; exact subscription never acts as wildcard; duplicate subscribe → event received twice; unsubscribing one ref leaves sibling on same topic; dead subscriber (single + multi-topic) fully cleaned; each subscribe returns unique ref; publish to empty topic is no-op; named registration works. Tests use `:sys.get_state(bus)` to sync after `:DOWN`.
- **Variations**: none (single problem family).
- **Subtasks**: 4 fill-in-the-middle — `_02` = `topic_matches?/2`; `_03` = `segments_match?/2` clauses; `_04` = `drop_subscription_entry/3`; `_05` = `clean_pid_refs/3`.
- **Notable**: monitor ref *is* the subscription identifier; wildcards only in subscriptions, never in published topic; only family with wildcard routing.

### 005_002_priorityeventbus — Priority-Ordered Serial Cancellable Delivery
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`, `:delivery_timeout_ms` default `5_000`); `subscribe(server, topic, pid, priority)` (integer priority, higher=earlier) `:: {:ok, ref}`; `unsubscribe/3 :: :ok`; `publish(server, topic, event) :: {:ok, delivered_count}` (called with `:infinity` timeout); `subscribers(server, topic) :: [{ref, pid, priority}]` (desc priority, then sub-order); `ack({bus_pid, unique_ref}) :: :ok` / `cancel({bus_pid, unique_ref}) :: :ok` (subscriber-side helpers that `send` `{:ack,ref}`/`{:cancel,ref}` to bus).
- **Approach**: GenServer, state `%{topics: %{topic => [sub]}, monitors: %{ref => {pid, [topic]}}, next_seq, delivery_timeout_ms}`, sub = `%{ref, pid, priority, seq}`. Kept sorted by `insert_sorted` = `Enum.sort_by({-priority, seq})`. Exact topic match only (no wildcards). Core is `deliver_serially/5`: for each sub in order, `make_ref()`, `send(pid, {:event, topic, event, {self(), unique_ref}})`, then blocking `receive` for `{:ack, ^ref}` (continue, +1), `{:cancel, ^ref}` (stop, count current +1 but skip rest), matching `:DOWN` (treat as ack, `send(self(), down)` to re-queue for normal cleanup, continue), or `after timeout` (treat as ack, continue). This blocks the GenServer for the whole publish — intentional serialization.
- **Key invariants tested**: delivery strictly descending priority regardless of subscribe order; ties by subscription order; high-priority `:cancel` suppresses all lower (delivered_count excludes skipped); `:ignore` policy subscriber times out (~200ms) and counts as ack without cancelling downstream; `"*"`/`"orders.*"` treated as literal strings (no wildcard); multi-sub per pid independently unsubscribable; `:DOWN` removes across topics. Test uses a `ScriptedSub` GenServer with `:ack`/`:cancel`/`{:sleep,ms,then}`/`:ignore` policies.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: 3 fill-in-the-middle — `_02` = `deliver_serially/5` (the ack/cancel/timeout loop); `_03` = `handle_call({:subscribe,...})`; `_04` = `remove_ref_from_topic/3`.
- **Notable**: reply_to is `{bus_pid, make_ref()}` (distinct from the monitor ref); handler runs in subscriber's own process via send+receive, never `GenServer.call` on subscriber; publish serializes all bus traffic behind it.

### 005_003_replayeventbus — Bounded Per-Topic Replay History
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`, `:default_history_size`=100, `:history_ttl_ms`=3_600_000, `:clock`=`fn -> System.monotonic_time(:millisecond) end`, `:cleanup_interval_ms`=60_000 or `:infinity` to disable); `subscribe(server, topic, pid, opts \\ [])` where `opts[:replay]` ∈ `:none` (default) | `:all` | positive-int `n`, `:: {:ok, ref}`; `unsubscribe/3`; `publish(server, topic, event) :: :ok`; `history(server, topic) :: [event]` (oldest→newest, TTL-applied); `set_history_size(server, topic, size)` (non-neg int, 0 disables/drops).
- **Approach**: GenServer, state `%{topics: %{topic => %{history: [{ts,event}], history_size, subs: [%{ref,pid}]}}, monitors, clock, default_history_size, history_ttl_ms, cleanup_interval_ms}`. History oldest-first; count bound via `Enum.take(-size)`, TTL via `evict_expired` = `Enum.drop_while(ts < now-ttl)`. **Replay-then-register atomicity**: subscribe handler runs inside one `GenServer.call` — snapshot history (post-TTL), `replay_events` sends selected events (`Enum.take(-n)` for int, all for `:all`) via `send/2` in order, *then* appends sub to topic — so an in-flight publish is either in history (seen in replay) or delivered live after registration, never missed/dup'd. Live and replay messages are indistinguishable (`{:event, topic, event}`). Periodic `:cleanup` (`Process.send_after`) evicts expired across topics and drops topics with empty history AND zero subs.
- **Key invariants tested**: default no-replay; `:all` and `:N` (with N>history → all) replay in order; replay precedes live; count bound (keeps last 10 of 15); `set_history_size` override + 0-disable; TTL eviction on replay/`history`; atomic no-miss-no-dup; `:DOWN` removes subs but preserves history; unsubscribe stops live but history keeps both; N subs per pid → N copies; cleanup evicts + drops empty-no-sub topics but keeps subbed topics with empty history.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none (only `_01`).
- **Notable**: only family with injected `:clock` (test uses an `Agent`-backed `Clock` with `advance/set`) and `:cleanup_interval_ms: :infinity` for determinism; history is per-topic not per-subscriber.

### 005_004_filteredeventbus — Content-Based Filter DSL Routing
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`); `subscribe(server, topic, pid, filter \\ [])` `:: {:ok, ref} | {:error, :invalid_filter}` (validates before calling GenServer); `unsubscribe/3`; `publish(server, topic, event) :: {:ok, matched_count}`; `test_filter(filter, event) :: boolean | {:error, :invalid_filter}` (pure, no GenServer).
- **Approach**: GenServer, state `%{topics: %{topic => [%{ref,pid,filter}]}, monitors}`. Exact topic match only. Filter = list of clauses, implicit AND (empty=always match). Clauses: `{:eq|:neq, path, v}`, `{:gt|:lt|:gte|:lte, path, v}` (numeric via `num_cmp` returning false if either operand non-number/nil), `{:in, path, list}`, `{:exists, path}` (non-nil), `{:any, [clauses]}` (OR), `{:none, [clauses]}` (NOT-OR). `path` = list of map keys / integer list indices navigated by `fetch/2` (`Map.fetch` for maps, `Enum.at(idx, :__missing__)` for lists, unresolved → `nil`, never raises). Two-phase: `valid_filter?`/`valid_clause?`/`valid_path?` structural validation (path elems must be atom/binary/integer; `:any`/`:none` need non-empty valid sub-lists) then `eval_filter`/`eval_clause`. `:DOWN` removes subs across topics.
- **Key invariants tested**: empty filter matches all; nested `:eq` path; `:neq`; numeric ops reject non-numeric/missing; `:in`; `:exists` (nil ≠ present); top-level AND; `:any` OR; `:none` exclusion; AND+nested `:any`; deep missing path → no crash/no match; integer list index `[:items, 0]`; invalid filters rejected (`:unknown_op`, non-list path, `{:any, []}`, float path elem `[3.14]`); `test_filter` pure booleans + same validation; multi-sub per pid → one delivery per matching sub; `matched_count` accuracy.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none (only `_01`).
- **Notable**: DSL is data-only (no `eval`/no anon-fn stored in state) so state stays serializable; validation is purely structural and never evaluates; replaces wildcards entirely with content routing.

## Group 006 — Caches

Four self-contained single-shot tasks (all `_01`; no variations, no fill-in-the-middle subtasks), each a single-file GenServer cache module using only OTP stdlib (no external deps). The common thread: an **injectable `:clock`** (zero-arity fn, default `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)` — except LRU defaults to bare `System.monotonic_time/0`) makes time deterministic in tests; every ExUnit harness defines an Agent-backed fake `Clock` (`now/advance/set`, LRU's variant auto-increments on each `now`). Modules progress in sophistication: plain TTL → count-bounded LRU → proactive refresh-ahead → two-tier stale-while-revalidate. The three async caches (003, 004) share nearly identical `Task.start_link` + `make_ref()` in-flight-token machinery for discarding stale background results, and use `:sys.get_state/1` as a synchronization barrier in tests.

### 006_001_ttl_cache_with_lazy_expiration — TTL Cache with Lazy Expiration
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (opts `:name`, `:clock`, `:sweep_interval_ms` default `60_000`); `put(server, key, value, ttl_ms) :: :ok`; `get(server, key) :: {:ok, value} | :miss`; `delete(server, key) :: :ok`.
- **Approach**: `GenServer`, `defstruct [:clock, :sweep_interval_ms, entries: %{}]`. Entry = `%{value, expires_at}` where `expires_at = clock.() + ttl_ms`. All ops are `handle_call`. Lazy expiration: `get` computes `clock.() < expires_at`; if expired returns `:miss` AND `Map.delete`s the key. Periodic `:sweep` via `Process.send_after(self(), :sweep, interval)` that `Enum.reject`s entries with `now >= expires_at` then reschedules itself.
- **Key invariants tested**: `:miss` for never-set/expired; lazy deletion actually removes from `state.entries` (checked via `:sys.get_state`); hit at `age=499`, miss at `age=501` for ttl 500; `put` fully resets TTL to `now + new_ttl`; key independence (a vs b); very short (1ms) / very large (86_400_000ms) TTLs; manual `send(cache, :sweep)` clears 100 expired keys, preserves live ones.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Tests pass `sweep_interval_ms: :infinity` to disable auto-sweep; helper `schedule_sweep/1` has a guard clause `when is_integer(interval_ms)` plus a catch-all returning `:ok`, so `:infinity` silently no-ops. Boundary uses strict `<` on read but `>=` in sweep (consistent: expired exactly at `expires_at`).

### 006_002_lrucache — LRU Cache (count-bounded)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (opts `:name`, **required** `:capacity` positive int, `:clock`); `put(server, key, value) :: :ok`; `get(server, key) :: {:ok, value} | :miss`; `delete(server, key) :: :ok`; `size(server) :: non_neg_integer`; `keys_by_recency(server) :: [key]` (MRU-first).
- **Approach**: `GenServer`, `defstruct [:clock, :capacity, entries: %{}]`. Entry = `%{value, access_ts}`. No TTL, no sweep, no `Process.send_after`. Both `put` (always) and `get`-on-hit refresh `access_ts = clock.()`. Eviction is intentionally **O(n)**: `evict_lru/1` uses `Enum.min_by(entries, & &1.access_ts)` and evicts exactly one entry only when inserting a NEW key at `map_size >= capacity`. `keys_by_recency` = `Enum.sort_by(..., :desc)`.
- **Key invariants tested**: `size` never exceeds capacity (insert 10 into cap-3 → size 3); `start_link` raises `ArgumentError` on capacity 0 or -1 (validated both in `start_link` and re-fetched in `init`); new put evicts oldest; `get` promotes to MRU changing which key is evicted next; `put` on existing key never evicts (count unchanged) but updates value+ts; a `:miss` get refreshes nothing; `delete` does NOT count as access and frees a slot; textbook LRU trace producing specific eviction order.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Prompt explicitly forbids DLL/ordered-map optimization — O(n) `Enum.min_by` is the wanted design; tie-breaking on equal `access_ts` is "arbitrary, don't special-case." Test `Clock.now` uses `get_and_update` returning strictly-increasing values so ordering is deterministic.

### 006_003_refreshaheadcache — Refresh-Ahead Cache
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (opts `:name`, `:clock`, `:sweep_interval_ms` default `60_000`/`:infinity`, `:refresh_threshold` float in `(0.0,1.0]` default `0.8`); `put(server, key, value, ttl_ms, loader)` (guarded `is_integer(ttl_ms) and ttl_ms>0 and is_function(loader,0)`) `:: :ok`; `get(server, key) :: {:ok, value} | :miss`; `delete(server, key) :: :ok`; `stats(server) :: %{entries, refreshes_in_flight}`.
- **Approach**: `GenServer`, `defstruct [:clock, :sweep_interval_ms, :refresh_threshold, entries: %{}, in_flight: %{}]`. Entry = `%{value, expires_at, ttl_ms, loader}` (stores loader + original ttl). `get`: hard-expiry (`now >= expires_at`) → lazy evict + `:miss`; else if `should_refresh?` (`age = now-(expires_at-ttl_ms); age >= threshold*ttl_ms`) AND not already `in_flight` → `spawn_refresh` and return current value; else return value. `spawn_refresh/2` = `make_ref()` + `Task.start_link` running `loader.()` in child, sends `{:refresh_complete, key, ref, val}` (or `{:refresh_failed, key, ref, reason}` via rescue/catch) to parent. `handle_info` applies result ONLY if entry exists AND `in_flight[key] == ^task_ref`, updating `expires_at = now + entry.ttl_ms` (preserves original TTL); otherwise discards.
- **Key invariants tested**: no loader call below threshold (`age 500 < 800`); one get past threshold returns OLD value + triggers exactly one loader call, next get sees new; refresh resets TTL to `now + original_ttl`; 10 rapid gets → exactly 1 in-flight (dedup); `delete` during in-flight discards result (via `Map.delete(in_flight)` so ref mismatches); `put` during in-flight clears in-flight so stale result can't clobber user value; failing loader leaves old value + clears in-flight; sweep removes hard-expired and prunes orphaned in-flight refs.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `refresh_threshold` stored as `* 1.0` (float-normalized). Sweep filters `in_flight` to only keys surviving in `pruned`. Tests use Agent-backed `Loader` (`next_value/0` counts calls, `slow_next_value(ms)` sleeps to widen the in-flight window) and a `wait_for_idle/2` poller on `stats.refreshes_in_flight`.

### 006_004_swrcache — Stale-While-Revalidate Cache
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (opts `:name`, `:clock`, `:sweep_interval_ms` default `60_000`/`:infinity`); `put(server, key, value, fresh_ms, stale_ms, loader)` (guarded: both positive ints, `is_function(loader,0)`) `:: :ok`; `get(server, key) :: {:ok, value, :fresh} | {:ok, value, :stale} | :miss`; `delete(server, key) :: :ok`; `stats(server) :: %{entries, revalidations_in_flight}`.
- **Approach**: `GenServer`, `defstruct [:clock, :sweep_interval_ms, entries: %{}, in_flight: %{}]`. Entry = `%{value, fresh_until, hard_expires_at, fresh_ms, stale_ms, loader}` where `fresh_until = now+fresh_ms`, `hard_expires_at = now+fresh_ms+stale_ms`. `get` three-way cond: `now >= hard_expires_at` → lazy evict + `:miss`; `now < fresh_until` → `{:ok, value, :fresh}` (no revalidation); else stale → `{:ok, value, :stale}` + `spawn_revalidate` if not in-flight. Same `make_ref()` + `Task.start_link` machinery as 003 (`{:revalidate_complete/failed, key, ref, ...}`); on complete, resets BOTH windows using entry's stored `fresh_ms`/`stale_ms`.
- **Key invariants tested**: exact three-way boundaries for `fresh_ms=1000, stale_ms=2000` (fresh `[0,1000)`, stale `[1000,3000)`, miss `>=3000`); stale read triggers exactly one revalidation, later read sees new value now-fresh; 10 concurrent stale reads → 1 in-flight; successful revalidation grants full fresh+stale budget; failed revalidation leaves entry stale so next read retries (test uses `:counters` to fail-then-succeed); `delete` and overwriting `put` invalidate in-flight so result is discarded; sweep removes only past-`hard_expires_at`, keeps stale-but-live.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Distinguished from refresh-ahead by the explicit `:fresh`/`:stale` tag in the return and a stale tier bounded by its own `stale_ms` (not a fraction of TTL). `put` validation is guard-clause based, so bad windows raise `FunctionClauseError` (not `ArgumentError`). Test `Loader.slow_next_value/1` again used to hold the in-flight window open.

## Group 007 — Streaming Statistics

Four independent `GenServer` modules that ingest numeric values into multiple named streams and answer online-statistics queries without storing unbounded history. Common thread: a `push`/query split, a `state.streams` map keyed by arbitrary `name` (streams fully independent), a "largest-period-ever-wins" memory bound (`max_period`/`max_window_size` grows, never shrinks), newest-first `values` lists, all math coerced to float via `x * 1.0`, and `{:error, :no_data}` before any push. Pure OTP stdlib, no external deps, no clock injection (nothing time-based — all windows are count-based). Each family has exactly one directory (`_01`, full single-shot WITH `test_harness.exs`); there are NO variation dirs (b=02+) and NO fill-in-the-middle subtasks (d=02+) in this cluster.

### 007_001_moving_average_calculator — Simple & Exponential Moving Average
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name` passthrough); `push(server, name, value) :: :ok`; `get(server, name, type, period) :: {:ok, float} | {:error, :no_data}` — guard `type in [:sma, :ema] and is_integer(period) and period > 0`.
- **Approach**: `GenServer.call` for both push and get. Per-stream map `%{values: [float] newest-first, max_period: int, total_count: int, ema: %{period => float}}`. SMA = `Enum.sum(Enum.take(values, period)) / length(window)` (cold-start uses all available). EMA multiplier `k = 2/(period+1)`, seeded with first value, applied over FULL history; maintained as one running accumulator per `(name, period)` — `push_value/2` updates every registered EMA accumulator (`ema_step/3`, `@compile {:inline}`). New EMA period bootstraps from current `values` buffer (`bootstrap_ema/2`, oldest-first via `Enum.reverse`).
- **Key invariants tested**: SMA cold-start = mean of all; SMA window slide drops old; EMA period-1 = latest value; EMA hand-calc (`[10,20,30]`,p3 → 22.5; `[1..5]`,p5 → 275/81); EMA over 5000 `sin` values matches iterative reduce (eps 1e-6); larger period grows buffer; `:sys.get_state` asserts SMA buffer ≤ 10 after 1000 pushes (bounded memory).
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Trimming deferred from `push_value` to `compute/3` (`trim_values` only when `period ≤ max_period`; when period grows, buffer left untouched). Subtle consequence: EMA "full history" bootstrap can only see the post-trim buffer, so bootstrap of a large new period after prior small-period trimming is lossy — tests never exercise this so it passes. Docstring documents the exact state layout and memory contract.

### 007_002_weightedmovingaverage — Weighted & Hull Moving Average
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)`; `push(server, name, value)` (guard `is_number(value)`, so non-numeric raises `FunctionClauseError`); `get(server, name, type, period) :: {:ok, float} | {:error, :no_data | :insufficient_data}` — guard `type in [:wma, :hma]`.
- **Approach**: WMA = linear weights newest=N…oldest=1, denominator `N*(N+1)/2` (`compute_wma/2` via `Enum.with_index` reduce; cold-start adjusts N to available count). HMA(P): `wma1 = WMA(div(P,2))`, `wma2 = WMA(P)`, `raw = 2*wma1 - wma2`, `hma = WMA(raw_buffer, round(sqrt(P)))`. Per-stream `%{values, max_period, hma: %{period => %{raw_buffer: [float]}}}`. Each `push_value/2` recomputes `raw` for EVERY registered HMA period and prepends to its `raw_buffer` (bounded `round(sqrt(period))`). New HMA period bootstraps by replaying all history oldest→newest (`bootstrap_raw_buffer/3`, iterates `for i <- (total-1)..0//-1` computing raw over each `Enum.drop(values, i)` suffix).
- **Key invariants tested**: WMA full window `[10..50]`,p5 → 550/15; WMA(3) of last-N; cold-start weights `[3,2,1]`/6; HMA(4) full hand-derivation → 35/9; HMA insufficient (< period values) → `:insufficient_data`; HMA increments across pushes (h4 ≠ h5); bootstrap-from-history matches fresh server; `max_period` grows to 10 without truncation; `:sys.get_state` asserts `values` length == 3.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `:no_data` when `values == []` (checked before insufficient); `:hma` with fewer than `period` values → `:insufficient_data` (whereas `:wma` cold-starts). Trim deferred until AFTER HMA bootstrap so history isn't lost. Push is O(distinct HMA periods × max_wma_period).

### 007_003_streamingpercentile — Sliding-Window Percentile / Quantile
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)`; `push(server, name, value, window_size)` (guard `is_number(value) and is_integer(window_size) and window_size > 0` → raises `FunctionClauseError` otherwise); `percentile(server, name, q) :: {:ok, float} | {:error, :no_data | :invalid_quantile}`; `percentiles(server, name, [_|_]=q_list) :: {:ok, %{q => float}} | {:error, ...}` (batch, one sort); `window(server, name) :: {:ok, [float]} | {:error, :no_data}` (returns insertion order oldest→newest via `Enum.reverse`).
- **Approach**: Per-stream `%{values: [float] newest-first, max_window_size: int}`. `push/4`: `new_max = max(max_window_size, window_size)`, prepend then `Enum.take(new_max)`. Query: `Enum.sort` ascending once, then `quantile/2`. Quantile = Hyndman-Fan type 7 / NumPy `"linear"` / Excel `PERCENTILE.INC`: `rank = q*(N-1)`, `lo = trunc(rank)`, `hi = min(lo+1, N-1)`, interpolate `lo_val + (rank-lo)*(hi_val-lo_val)`; single-element window short-circuits. Quantile validation (`valid_quantile?`: `q>=0.0 and q<=1.0`) done in the CLIENT process before `GenServer.call`.
- **Key invariants tested**: q=0→min, q=1→max; odd median = middle; even median interpolates (`[10,20,30,40]` p50 → 25); p25 of 1..10 → 3.25, p95 → 9.55; batch p50/p95/p99 of 1..100 → 50.5/95.05/99.01; window bounded drops oldest; `max_window_size` grows and never shrinks (length reaches 8 then 9, `:sys.get_state` == 10); duplicates; invalid q → `:invalid_quantile` (no partial results in batch).
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Simplest module (no separate `handle` for growth — inline in push clause). `Enum.at/2` on a list makes quantile O(N) per index lookup; prompt explicitly declares O(N log N) sort-per-query is intended scope (no skip-list/order-stat tree). `percentile/3` accepts integer q too (`is_float(q) or is_integer(q)`).

### 007_004_cusumanomaly — CUSUM Change-Point Detection + Welford
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` — opts `:threshold` (default 5.0), `:slack` (0.5), `:warmup_samples` (10), `:epsilon` (1.0e-6), `:name`; `push(server, name, value) :: :ok | :warming_up | {:alert, :upward_shift | :downward_shift}` (guard `is_number`); `check(server, name) :: {:ok, %{mean, stddev, s_high, s_low, samples, status: :normal | :warming_up}} | {:error, :no_data}`; `reset(server, name) :: :ok` (no-op if stream absent).
- **Approach**: Global config in top-level state, per-stream `%{samples, mean, m2, s_high, s_low}`. Welford online mean/variance (`welford_update/2`; `welford_stddev` = `sqrt(m2/n)` population). On push: if `samples < warmup_samples` → Welford-only + `:warming_up`; else z-score against PRIOR mean/stddev `z = (value - mean) / max(stddev, epsilon)`, then `s_high = max(0, s_high + z - slack)`, `s_low = max(0, s_low - z - slack)`, then Welford update. `s_high >= threshold` → `{:alert, :upward_shift}` + full reset; else `s_low >= threshold` → `:downward_shift` + reset (upward checked first).
- **Key invariants tested**: < warmup → `:warming_up`; warmup-th push → `:normal`+`:ok`; Welford mean/stddev of classic `[2,4,4,4,5,5,7,9]` (stddev 2.0); stable 500-sample signal never alerts; sustained +10 jump → upward alert; sustained −8 → downward alert; post-alert state fully zeroed (`samples==0`, `status==:warming_up`); manual `reset/2`; reset on unknown stream stays `:no_data`; per-stream isolation; bad opts raise `ArgumentError` (`validate!` in `start_link`); non-numeric raises `FunctionClauseError`.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Two behaviors DIVERGE from prompt yet pass tests: (1) alert doesn't produce a re-learning reset — it stores `alerted: true` (`alerted_stream/0`), and subsequent pushes are FROZEN returning `:warming_up` until explicit `reset` (prompt said reset-and-re-learn immediately). (2) Undocumented extra guard: when CUSUM-active but `welford_stddev < slack`, returns `:ok` and updates Welford only, skipping CUSUM (guards against false alerts on near-zero variance). Options parsed twice (once in `start_link` for `validate!`, again in `init`); only `start_link` validates. Push return type is bare `{:alert, dir}`, but `@spec`/prompt bullet phrasing both list it as `{:alert, :upward_shift}`.

## Group 008 — CRDTs

Four independent GenServer-based CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) implementations, each a self-contained single-file module using only OTP stdlib (no deps). Every family follows an identical shape: a `use GenServer` module with `start_link(opts)` accepting `:name`, mutation/query ops via `GenServer.call`, plus a **state/2 + merge/2** pair for gossip-style replication. All merges are proven idempotent/commutative/associative by dedicated tests that spin up multiple processes, snapshot `state/1`, cross-merge, and assert convergence of both `members`/`value` and raw `state`. Timestamps/counters are caller-supplied or internally monotonic (no wall clock), keeping tests deterministic. The four are the canonical CRDT progression: PN-Counter → LWW-Element-Set → 2P-Set → OR-Set. All four families have only the `_01` single-shot dir (with `test_harness.exs`); no b=02+ variations and no d=02+ fill-in-the-middle subtasks exist.

### 008_001_distributed_counter_with_crdt_style_merge — PN-Counter (Distributed Counter)
- **Interface**: `Counter.start_link(opts)`; `increment(server, node_id, amount \\ 1) :: :ok`; `decrement(server, node_id, amount \\ 1) :: :ok`; `value(server) :: integer()`; `merge(server, remote_state) :: :ok`; `state(server) :: %{p: g_counter, n: g_counter}`.
- **Approach**: Two grow-only G-Counters as maps `p` (per-node increments) and `n` (per-node decrements). Value = `sum(p) - sum(n)`. Ops use `update_in(state, [:p, node_id], &((&1 || 0) + amount))`. Merge = per-node `max` via `Map.merge/3` fold on each of `p` and `n` independently.
- **Key invariants tested**: value can go negative; per-node accumulation; merge takes max (never lowers counts); absent remote decrement treated as 0; idempotent/commutative/associative; empty-merge no-op; 100-node and 1M-magnitude cases.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `increment`/`decrement` validate amount client-side (before the call) via `validate_amount!/2`, raising `ArgumentError` on non-positive integers. `merge/2` guards on `%{p: p, n: n}` with `is_map` and re-raises `ArgumentError` for malformed remote state. `node_id` is any term.

### 008_002_lww_element_set_crdt — LWW-Element-Set (Last-Writer-Wins)
- **Interface**: `LWWSet.start_link(opts)`; `add(server, element, timestamp) :: :ok`; `remove(server, element, timestamp) :: :ok`; `member?(server, element) :: boolean`; `members(server) :: MapSet.t`; `merge(server, remote_state) :: :ok`; `state(server) :: %{adds: ts_map, removes: ts_map}`.
- **Approach**: Two maps `adds`/`removes` of `element => latest_timestamp`. add/remove keep `max(current, timestamp)` per element (`update_in` with nil→ts clause). Presence: `add_ts > remove_ts` (remove defaults to 0 if absent). Merge = per-element `max` of both maps via `Map.merge/3`.
- **Key invariants tested**: **remove-wins on tie** (`add_ts == remove_ts` ⇒ absent, strict `>`); remove-before-add (lower ts) doesn't block membership; re-add with higher ts restores; repeated add keeps max ts; merge doesn't lower ts; remote remove overrides local add; CRDT props; string elements; named registration.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Timestamps are caller-supplied positive integers (`validate_timestamp!/2` raises `ArgumentError` otherwise) — no injected clock. `members` filters `adds` by `add_ts > Map.get(removes, elem, 0)` into a MapSet.

### 008_003_two_phase_set_crdt — 2P-Set (Two-Phase Set)
- **Interface**: `TwoPhaseSet.start_link(opts)`; `add(server, element) :: :ok`; `remove(server, element) :: :ok`; `member?(server, element) :: boolean`; `members(server) :: MapSet.t`; `merge(server, remote_state) :: :ok`; `state(server) :: %{added: MapSet, removed: MapSet}`.
- **Approach**: Two grow-only G-Sets (`MapSet`s) `added` and `removed` (tombstones). Present = `MapSet.difference(added, removed)` / `member? and not member?`. Merge = `MapSet.union` on each set independently. `merge/2` coerces incoming values with `MapSet.new/1`.
- **Key invariants tested**: **permanent removal** — re-adding a tombstoned element raises `ArgumentError` (`:tombstoned`); removing a non-member or already-removed element raises `ArgumentError` (`:not_a_member`); add of present element is no-op; tombstone stays in both `added` and `removed`; merge is grow-only (`MapSet.subset?` before⊆after); tombstone propagation makes locally-added element disappear post-merge and un-re-addable; CRDT props.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Validation is server-side: `handle_call` returns `{:error, :tombstoned}`/`{:error, :not_a_member}` and the client API wrapper converts to `ArgumentError` with element-specific messages. No timestamps/tags — this is the "no causal metadata" tradeoff.

### 008_004_observed_remove_set_crdt — OR-Set (Observed-Remove / Add-Wins Set)
- **Interface**: `ORSet.start_link(opts)`; `add(server, element, node_id) :: :ok`; `remove(server, element) :: :ok`; `member?(server, element) :: boolean`; `members(server) :: MapSet.t`; `merge(server, remote_state) :: :ok`; `state(server) :: %{entries: %{element => MapSet.t(tag)}, tombstones: MapSet.t(tag), clock: %{node_id => counter}}` where `tag = {node_id, counter}`.
- **Approach**: Each `add` mints a unique tag `{node_id, counter}` from an internal per-node monotonic `clock` (`Map.get(clock, node_id, 0) + 1`); tag added to that element's MapSet in `entries`. `remove` moves **all** of an element's current tags into `tombstones` and deletes the element key from `entries`. Merge: union tombstones, union per-element tag sets across all element keys, then `MapSet.difference(merged_tags, merged_tombstones)` to drop tombstoned tags (empty ⇒ element key omitted), and per-node `max` on clocks.
- **Key invariants tested**: **add-wins on concurrent add/remove** — flagship test: after both nodes share `{:a,1}`, node_a re-adds (`{:a,2}`) while node_b removes (tombstones `{:a,1}`); post bidirectional merge `:x` survives because `{:a,2}` ∉ tombstones. Also: remove-then-readd generates fresh tag (multi-cycle); each add is a distinct tag even same node; clock increments per node; removing non-member raises `ArgumentError`; state after remove drops the entries key but keeps tombstone; CRDT props; empty-merge no-op.
- **Variations**: none.
- **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `remove` returns `{:error, :not_a_member}` server-side → `ArgumentError` at API. The remove handler has an unusual guard `{:ok, tags} when tags != %MapSet{}` plus a redundant inner `MapSet.size(tags) == 0` check. `merge/2` guards on `%{entries:, tombstones:, clock:}` with `is_map` on entries/clock and `MapSet.new(tombstones)` coercion. `node_id` any term; clock is the only stateful counter (determinism from insertion order, no wall clock).

## Groups 009 + 010 — Coalescing / Dedup & Stores

Eight self-contained single-shot tasks (all `_001_..._01`; no `b=02+` variations, no `d=02+` fill-in-the-middle subtasks exist in this cluster). Every task is a single-file `GenServer` using only OTP stdlib (no external deps). Group 009 is about **concurrency coordination per key** (deduplicate/coalesce/gate in-flight work, spawning `Task.start` so the GenServer never blocks, replying to many `GenServer.from()` refs at once). Group 010 is about **keyed stores with time-based expiration** (sessions, tokens, leases, quotas), all sharing an identical scaffold: an injectable `:clock` zero-arity fn (default `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)`), lazy expiry-on-access, and a periodic `Process.send_after(self(), :cleanup, ...)` sweep. The two 010-style patterns to contrast are **sliding-window** (session, reset on access) vs **absolute** (token/lease/quota, never extended on read).

### 009_001 — Request Deduplicator / Coalescer (`Dedup`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`); `execute(server, key, func)` where `func` is arity-0, calls `GenServer.call(server, {:execute, key, func}, :infinity)`.
- **Approach**: State is `%{key => [GenServer.from()]}` — key present iff a task is in flight; value is arrival-ordered wait list. First caller: `Task.start` runs `func` under `try/rescue`, sends `{:task_done, key, result}` to parent; caller registered as `[from]`. Concurrent same-key callers appended (`callers ++ [from]`), do NOT re-invoke `func`. On `handle_info({:task_done,...})`, `Map.pop` the list and `GenServer.reply` each with the same result, clearing the key.
- **Result normalisation**: `{:ok, v}`→as-is; `{:error, r}`→as-is; other `v`→`{:ok, v}`; raise→`{:error, {:exception, exception}}`.
- **Key invariants tested**: N concurrent same-key calls → `func` runs exactly once (Agent counter==1), all get same result; distinct keys run independently/concurrently (counter==5); key cleared after success AND after error so next call re-runs; error/exception broadcast to all waiters; GenServer stays responsive during a 500ms slow func (fast call <200ms); sequential same-key calls each re-execute.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `Task.start` (fire-and-forget, not `Task.async`/monitored) — a crash outside `rescue` would silently leave the key stuck, but `func` errors are all caught by `rescue`. Only `rescue` (no `catch` for exits/throws).

### 009_002 — Write-Behind Batch Coalescer (`BatchCollector`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`, **required** `:flush_interval_ms`); `submit(server, key, item, flush_fn, opts \\ [])` — `flush_fn` is arity-1 (receives item list in submission order), `opts[:max_batch_size]` default 10; `pending_count(server, key)` → integer.
- **Approach**: State `%{flush_interval_ms, batches: %{key => %{items, callers, flush_fn, max_batch_size, timer_ref}}}`. First `submit` for a key starts `Process.send_after(self(), {:flush_timer, key}, interval)` and buffers item; items/callers **prepended** (O(1)), reversed at flush for order. Flush triggers when `length(items) >= max_batch_size` OR the `:flush_timer` fires. `do_flush` pops the key (prevents new items joining a dying batch), cancels timer, spawns `Task.start` running `flush_fn` under `try/rescue`, sends `{:batch_done, callers, result}` → all replied.
- **Key invariants tested**: single item flushes on timer (~100ms measured); concurrent submitters batched (flush_fn once, all get `{:ok, 15}`); order preserved (sorted); `max_batch_size: 3` flushes before timer (<300ms); timer flush waits ~80-300ms; independent per-key batches/timers; error+exception broadcast; key cleared after flush/error; stale `:flush_timer` after threshold-flush harmlessly ignored (key `:error`).
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `max_batch_size <= 1` special-cased to flush immediately on first submit. Same `Task.start` + `{:ok,_}/{:error,_}/other` normalisation as 009_001.

### 009_003 — Retry-Aware Request Deduplicator (`RetryDedup`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`); `execute(server, key, func, opts \\ [])` with `:max_retries` (default 3), `:base_delay_ms` (100), `:max_delay_ms` (5000); `status(server, key)` → `:idle | {:retrying, attempt, max_retries}` (attempt 1-based).
- **Approach**: Dedup (like 009_001) PLUS exponential backoff. State `%{key => %{callers, func, retry_config, attempt, status}}` (`attempt` 0=initial). `spawn_attempt` = `Task.start` → `{:task_result, key, result}`. On success → reply all, delete key. On `{:error,_}`: if `attempt < max_retries`, `Process.send_after(self(), {:retry_now, key}, delay)`, bump attempt, status `:waiting_retry`; else reply all with last error, delete key. `{:retry_now, key}` re-spawns same `func`. Delay = `min(base * 2^(attempt-1), max_delay_ms)` via `Integer.pow`.
- **Key invariants tested**: retries then succeeds (initial+2 = 3 calls); exhausted returns last error (initial+3 = 4 calls); exception retried & wrapped; callers arriving mid-retry-sequence share eventual result without restarting retries; `status` is `:idle` during attempt 0 (first run), `{:retrying, _, max}` once retrying, `:idle` after done; backoff delays monotonically increasing (~50/100/200); key cleared after final success/failure; responsiveness during retries.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: exceptions treated as `{:error, {:exception, e}}` for retry purposes (so raises ARE retried, unlike some designs). `status` deliberately reports `:idle` during the very first attempt (attempt==0).

### 009_004 — Per-Key Bounded Concurrency Pool (`KeyedPool`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`, **required** `:max_concurrency` positive int — `start_link` raises `ArgumentError` otherwise); `execute(server, key, func)` (arity-0); `status(server, key)` → `%{running: n, queued: n}` (`%{running: 0, queued: 0}` for idle/unknown).
- **Approach**: NOT dedup — every caller's own `func` runs; pool only gates concurrency. State `%{max_concurrency, keys: %{key => %{running, queue: [{from, func}], tasks: %{ref => from}}}}`. If `running < max`, `start_task` (make_ref, `Task.start`, `{:task_done, key, ref, result}`); else append `{from, func}` to FIFO queue. On `:task_done`: `Map.pop` ref→reply that caller, decrement running, `maybe_start_next` dequeues head and starts it; key deleted from map when `running==0 and queue==[]`.
- **Key invariants tested**: each caller gets its OWN result (values `[1..5]`); all funcs run (counter==5, contrasted with dedup); peak concurrency ≤ max; FIFO order strict (`[:blocker,:first,:second,:third]`); independent keys run in parallel (~100ms not 300ms); `status` running/queued counts (2/2) then cleaned to zeros; crashed/erroring task still frees slot for next queued caller; `ArgumentError` on `max_concurrency: 0`/`-1`; stress 40 callers × 4 keys.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: uses `make_ref()` per task to map completion → caller. `Task.start` (unmonitored) but result always captured via `try/rescue`, so a "crash" is really a caught exception that still sends `:task_done`.

### 010_001 — Session Store w/ Inactivity Timeout (`SessionStore`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`, `:timeout_ms` default 1_800_000, `:cleanup_interval_ms` default 60_000, `:clock`); `create(server, data)`→`{:ok, session_id}`; `get`→`{:ok, data}|{:error, :not_found}` (**resets timer**); `update(server, id, new_data)`→`{:ok, new_data}|{:error,:not_found}` (**resets timer**); `touch`→`:ok|{:error,:not_found}` (**resets timer**); `destroy`→`:ok` always.
- **Approach**: **Sliding window**. State `%{sessions: %{id => %{data, last_active}}, timeout_ms, cleanup_interval_ms, clock}`. Every read/update/touch sets `last_active = now`. `expired?` = `now - last_active >= timeout_ms`. `fetch_live_session` returns `{:ok,_}|:expired|:missing`; `:expired` deletes lazily. Periodic `:cleanup` uses `Map.filter` to drop expired. IDs: `:crypto.strong_rand_bytes(16) |> Base.url_encode64(padding: false)` (~22 chars).
- **Key invariants tested**: sliding reset via get/touch/update keeps alive across 5×800ms cycles; expiry at ≥timeout (999 alive, 1001 dead); session independence; destroy idempotent & isolated; sweep empties 100 expired but keeps active; various data types; 1ms-timeout edge.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `@default_clock &__MODULE__.__default_clock__/0` public wrapper (comment: avoids capturing a private fn in some compile contexts). Tests inject a fake `Clock` Agent (`now/advance/set`) and use `cleanup_interval_ms: :infinity` (`schedule_cleanup` guards on `is_integer`, no-ops for `:infinity`). Cleanup driven manually via `send(store, :cleanup)` + `:sys.get_state/1` sync.

### 010_002 — One-Time Token Store w/ Absolute Expiration (`OneTimeTokenStore`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`, `:default_ttl_ms` default 3_600_000, `:cleanup_interval_ms`, `:clock`); `mint(server, payload, opts \\ [])` (`opts[:ttl_ms]` override)→`{:ok, token_id}`; `verify`→`{:ok, payload}|{:error,:not_found}` (**non-destructive, does NOT extend**); `redeem`→`{:ok, payload}|{:error,:not_found}` (consumes/deletes, single-use); `revoke`→`:ok` always; `active_count(server)`→count of non-expired tokens.
- **Approach**: **Absolute deadline** `expires_at = now + ttl_ms` at mint, never touched on access (contrast 010_001). State `%{tokens: %{id => %{payload, expires_at}}, ...}`. `expired?` = `now >= expires_at`. `verify` reads without deleting live tokens (but deletes on `:expired`); `redeem` deletes on success; `revoke` unconditional delete; `active_count` = `Enum.count(not expired?)`.
- **Key invariants tested**: verify non-consuming (repeatable); redeem consumes (2nd redeem fails); verify fails post-redeem/revoke; **verify does NOT extend** (verify at 800ms then expired at 1100ms — explicitly the sliding-vs-absolute discriminator); per-token `:ttl_ms` override; independence; `active_count` reflects redeem+expiry; sweep; 1ms TTL; double-redeem & revoke-then-redeem rejected.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Structurally near-identical scaffold to 010_001 but `>=` absolute semantics and adds `active_count`. Same clock/cleanup test harness pattern.

### 010_003 — Exclusive Lease Manager w/ Ownership (`LeaseManager`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`, `:lease_duration_ms` default 30_000, `:cleanup_interval_ms`, `:clock`); `acquire(server, resource, owner)`→`{:ok, lease_id}|{:error, :already_held, current_owner}`; `release(server, resource, owner)`→`:ok|{:error, :not_held}`; `renew(server, resource, owner)`→`{:ok, new_expires_at}|{:error,:not_held}`; `holder(server, resource)`→`{:ok, owner, expires_at}|{:error, :available}`; `force_release(server, resource)`→`:ok` always (admin).
- **Approach**: Mutual-exclusion primitive: at most one live lease per resource. State `%{leases: %{resource => %{lease_id, owner, expires_at}}, ...}`. `acquire` grants only if `:expired`/`:missing`; a live lease → `{:error, :already_held, lease.owner}` (**NOT idempotent** — same owner re-acquire also errors). `release`/`renew` guarded by `when lease.owner == owner`; wrong owner → `{:error, :not_held}`; expired → delete + `:not_held`. `renew` sets `expires_at = now + duration`. `holder` returns owner+expiry or `:available`.
- **Key invariants tested**: acquire grants; second/same owner both get `:already_held` w/ current owner; release only by owner (wrong owner `:not_held`), re-acquire after release; holder returns exact `expires_at==1000`; expiry frees for other owner; release/renew of expired → `:not_held`; renew extends from now (800→1800), repeated renews keep alive; force_release ignores owner; resource independence; arbitrary term resources/owners; sweep.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: The distinguishing feature vs other stores is **ownership-guarded mutation** (`when lease.owner == owner` guards) and the 3-tuple `{:error, :already_held, owner}` return. Same clock/cleanup harness.

### 010_004 — Rolling-Window Quota Tracker (`QuotaTracker`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`, `:max_window_ms` default 3_600_000, `:cleanup_interval_ms`, `:clock`); `record(server, key, amount, quota, window_ms)`→`{:ok, remaining}|{:error, :quota_exceeded, overage}` (**all-or-nothing**, rejected recordings NOT stored); `remaining(server, key, quota, window_ms)`→`{:ok, remaining}` (read-only, evicts, `max(_,0)`); `usage(server, key, window_ms)`→`{:ok, total}`; `reset(server, key)`→`:ok`; `keys(server)`→`[key]` (all keys w/ any entries, NOT window-filtered).
- **Approach**: Per-key list of `%{amount, recorded_at}` timestamped entries (prepended). Two eviction windows: per-call `window_ms` (for the usage math) and store-level `max_window_ms` (for what's retained/leaked). `evict_expired` keeps `recorded_at > now - window_ms`. `record`: compute `current_usage` over `window_ms`; if `current_usage + amount > quota` → reject with `overage = current_usage + amount - quota`, but still retain (via max_window) without adding; else prepend new entry, `remaining = quota - (current_usage + amount)`. Sweep maps each key through `evict_expired(..., max_window_ms)` and rejects now-empty keys.
- **Key invariants tested**: record returns remaining; accumulation (3 then 5 of 10 → remaining 2); exceed rejected w/ exact overage (1), rejected doesn't consume; unknown key → full quota / 0 usage; entries expire after window; expired usage frees quota; partial expiry (t=0 drops, t=500 kept); reset clears; independence; `keys` sorted; exact boundary (record 10 of 10 → remaining 0), 1-over fails; `record` amount 0 succeeds w/o effect; **same key with different `window_ms` gives different visible usage** (1000ms→3, 2000ms→8); sweep drops fully-expired keys but keeps active.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: The only 010 store with a **quantity/quota** dimension rather than presence/expiry, and the only one where the query-time `window_ms` is a per-call parameter decoupled from the retention `max_window_ms`. Boundary is strict `>` on `recorded_at > cutoff` (entry at exactly `now - window_ms` is evicted). Same fake-Clock + manual `:cleanup` harness as the rest of 010.

Cross-cluster notes for a newcomer: all 8 tests use `use ExUnit.Case, async: false`; 009 tests rely on real `Process.sleep`/`:timer.tc` timing + `Agent` counters, whereas 010 tests are fully deterministic via an injected `Clock` Agent and `cleanup_interval_ms: :infinity` with manual `send(pid, :cleanup)` + `:sys.get_state/1`. Every 010 module shares the identical `@default_clock &__MODULE__.__default_clock__/0` idiom, `schedule_cleanup/1` with an `is_integer` guard, a `fetch_live_*` `{:ok,_}|:expired|:missing` helper, lazy delete-on-expired-access, and a `handle_info(msg, state)` catch-all that `Logger.warning`s. All 009 modules share `Task.start` + `try/rescue` normalisation (`{:ok,_}`/`{:error,_}`/other→`{:ok,other}`/raise→`{:error,{:exception,e}}`) and reply-to-many-`from`s via `handle_info` result messages.

## Groups 011 + 012 — Worker Pools & Event-Sourced Aggregates

Two thematic clusters of self-contained OTP exercises. **011** = four incremental variants of a GenServer-managed worker pool (bounded FIFO queue → priority+starvation → cancellation → per-task timeout+retry), each built on a `DynamicSupervisor` of `:temporary` worker GenServers, `Process.monitor` for crash detection, and a client-side `await/3` that is a *bare mailbox `receive`* (the pool `send`s results directly to the caller pid, so the `pool` arg to `await` is ignored). **012** = four isomorphic event-sourced aggregate GenServers (bank account, subscription, inventory, task tracker) sharing one skeleton: a `store = %{id => %{state, events}}` map, `validate_command → apply_event → append`, independent per-id state, plain-map events with a `:type` key. No clock is injected anywhere — pool timing tests use real `Process.sleep` and `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)`; aggregates are purely synchronous/deterministic. All eight dirs are `_01` single-shot tasks (full three-file set); no `b=02+` variations and no `d=02+` fill-in-the-middle subtasks exist in this cluster (the `b` field here indexes distinct families, not variations). No external deps.

Shared pool mechanics (apply to all 011 families): `start_link/1` accepts `:pool_size` (default 3), `:max_queue` (default 10), `:name`; workers spawned in `init` via `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(sup, {…Worker, [self()]})` and each `Process.monitor`ed (`monitors: %{mref => pid}`); dispatch is instant to an idle worker else enqueue (`:queue`) else `{:error, :queue_full}`; worker runs `func.()` *synchronously inside `handle_info({:run, …})`* and `send`s `{:task_finished, self(), ref, result}` back; a `func` that raises crashes the worker → `{:DOWN, …}` → client notified + replacement worker started + `dispatch_next` immediately re-fills it from the queue. `submit` returns `{:ok, ref}` with `ref = make_ref()`.

### 011_001_bounded_mailbox_worker_pool — Bounded-Mailbox Worker Pool
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)`; `submit(pool, task_func)` (0-arity fn) → `{:ok, ref}` | `{:error, :queue_full}`; `await(pool, ref, timeout \\ 5_000)` → `{:ok, result}` | `{:error, :timeout}` | `{:error, {:task_crashed, reason}}`; `status(pool)` → `%{busy_workers, idle_workers, queue_length}`.
- **Approach**: single `GenServer` (`WorkerPool`) + inner `WorkerPool.Worker` (`use GenServer, restart: :temporary`). `State` struct: `queue: :queue.new()`, `idle_workers: [pid]`, `busy_workers: %{pid => {ref, client_pid}}`, `monitors: %{mref => pid}`. FIFO via Erlang `:queue`. `handle_call({:submit,…}, {from_pid,_}, …)` uses `cond`: idle→dispatch, `:queue.len < max_queue`→enqueue, else reject.
- **Key invariants tested**: FIFO order (release workers one at a time, assert `{:executed, i}` in order); queue rejects the overflow submit; `status` counts accurate; crash returns `{:error, {:task_crashed, _}}` and awaiter of queued task behind a crash still gets `{:ok, :survived}`; worker count restored to `pool_size` after crash; `pool_size: 1` and `max_queue: 0` (busy → immediate reject) edge cases; unknown/`make_ref()` await → `{:error, :timeout}`.
- **Variations**: none present. **Subtasks**: none present.
- **Notable**: DOWN handler distinguishes busy (`Map.pop(busy_workers, pid)`) vs idle worker death; awaiter decoupled from server (client-side `receive` on `{^ref, :result|:error, …}`).

### 011_002_priority_worker_pool_with_starvation_prevention — Priority Pool w/ Starvation Prevention
- **Interface**: adds `:promote_after_ms` (default 5_000) to `start_link`; `submit(pool, task_func, priority \\ :normal)` with `priority in [:high, :normal, :low]` (guard `priority in @priorities`); `status` → `%{busy_workers, idle_workers, queue_high, queue_normal, queue_low, total_queue_length}`.
- **Approach**: `State.queues = %{high:, normal:, low:} ` (each a `:queue`); tasks stored as `{ref, client_pid, func, enqueued_at}` where `enqueued_at = System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)`. `dequeue_highest/1` scans `[:high, :normal, :low]` via `reduce_while`. `max_queue` bounds the *sum* (`total_queue_length`). Starvation: `schedule_promotion` = `Process.send_after(self(), :promote_stale_tasks, promote_after_ms)`; handler `partition_stale/3` splits each queue by `now - enqueued_at >= threshold`, promotes low→normal and normal→high (appended to *back* of target queue), reschedules.
- **Key invariants tested**: high dequeued before normal before low; FIFO within a level; per-priority `status` counts; queue-full rejects across all priorities; low task promoted after `promote_after_ms` (setup uses 500ms) runs before a later-submitted fresh normal.
- **Variations**: none present. **Subtasks**: none present.
- **Notable**: idle-worker dispatch ignores priority (nobody waiting); promotion loses intra-level age ordering (appends to back) but tests don't exercise that; only normal/high pumped by promotion each tick (a low task needs two ticks to reach high).

### 011_003_cancellable_worker_pool — Cancellable Worker Pool
- **Interface**: same as 001 plus `cancel(pool, ref)` → `:ok` | `{:error, :not_found}`; `await` adds `{:error, :cancelled}`; `status` adds `:cancelled_count` (cumulative). Module `CancellablePool`.
- **Approach**: `State` adds `pending_refs: %{ref => client_pid}` (tracks *queued* refs), `cancelled_refs: MapSet` (running refs killed via cancel, to distinguish from genuine crash in DOWN), `cancelled_count`. `handle_call({:cancel, ref},…)`: if in `pending_refs` → `queue_remove/2` (rebuild `:queue` minus ref) + send `{ref, :error, :cancelled}`; elif running (`find_busy_worker` by ref) → `Process.exit(worker, :kill)` + mark in `cancelled_refs` + send `:cancelled`; else `{:error, :not_found}`. DOWN handler checks `MapSet.member?(cancelled_refs, ref)` → skip the `task_crashed` message (already sent), just cleanup.
- **Key invariants tested**: cancel pending removes from queue + frees a slot; cancel running kills worker, notifies awaiter, replacement picks up next queued task; unknown/completed/double-cancel → `{:error, :not_found}`; `cancelled_count` increments per cancel; non-cancellation crash still yields `{:task_crashed, …}`.
- **Variations**: none present. **Subtasks**: none present.
- **Notable**: cancel uses `:kill` (untrappable) to preempt a running task; the `cancelled_refs` MapSet is the mechanism that prevents a cancel from being misreported as a crash.

### 011_004_worker_pool_with_per_task_timeouts_and_retry — Retry Pool w/ Per-Task Timeouts
- **Interface**: `submit(pool, task_func, opts \\ [])` with `:task_timeout` (default 30_000) and `:max_retries` (default 0, meaning no retries); `await` errors: `{:error, {:task_failed, reason, attempts}}` (retries exhausted on crash) and `{:error, {:task_timeout, attempts}}` (final attempt timed out); `status` adds `:retry_count`. Module `RetryPool`.
- **Approach**: per-task `%TaskInfo{ref, client_pid, func, task_timeout, max_retries, attempts: 0}` stored as the busy value (`busy_workers: %{pid => %TaskInfo{}}`). `dispatch_to_worker/3` increments `attempts`, sends `{:run,…}`, and arms `Process.send_after(self(), {:task_timeout, worker}, task_timeout)`; timer bookkeeping in `timers: %{tref => pid}` + `worker_timers: %{pid => tref}` (`cancel_task_timer/2` on completion). On `:task_timeout` → `Process.exit(worker, :kill)` and stash `{:timed_out, task_info}` in `busy_workers` so the ensuing `:DOWN` is classified as timeout vs crash. `handle_task_failure/3`: if `attempts <= max_retries` re-enqueue at **front** via `:queue.in_r` + bump `retry_count`; else send terminal error. Retried tasks jump the queue front; new submissions are FIFO.
- **Key invariants tested**: crash w/ `max_retries: 0` → `{:task_failed, _, 1}`; flaky task (Agent counter) succeeds after N failures with exact total-attempt count; timeout w/o retries → `{:task_timeout, 1}`; timeout then retry succeeds; timeout exhausting retries → `{:task_timeout, 2}`; `retry_count` equals number of failed attempts; `await` short timeout fires even while task is mid-retry.
- **Variations**: none present. **Subtasks**: none present.
- **Notable**: `attempts` incremented at dispatch (so count is 1-based on first run); test harness introduces `flaky_task/3` built on an `Agent` counter; `{:timed_out, task_info}` tuple in `busy_workers` is the timeout-vs-crash discriminator (mirrors 003's `cancelled_refs` trick).

### 012_001_event_sourced_aggregate — Bank Account Event-Sourced Aggregate
- **Interface** (`Aggregate`): `start_link(opts)` (`:name`, seeds state `%{}`); `execute(server, id, command)` → `{:ok, [event]}` | `{:error, reason}`; `state(server, id)` → `%{name, balance, status: :open}` | `nil`; `events(server, id)` → oldest-first list. Commands: `{:open, name}`, `{:deposit, amount}`, `{:withdraw, amount}`.
- **Approach**: `GenServer` state = `store :: %{id => %{state, events}}`. `handle_call({:execute,…})`: `validate_command(current.state, cmd)` → events, `Enum.reduce(events, state, &apply_event/2)`, `events ++ new_events` (O(n) append). `get_state` via `get_in(store, [id, :state])`. Events: `%{type: :account_opened, name}`, `:amount_deposited`/`:amount_withdrawn` w/ `:amount`. `apply_event(:account_opened, _nil)` builds `%{name, balance: 0, status: :open}`.
- **Key invariants tested**: open twice → `:already_open`; deposit/withdraw before open → `:account_not_open`; non-positive amount → `:invalid_amount`; over-withdraw → `:insufficient_balance` (balance unchanged); exact-balance withdraw → 0; failed commands append no events; per-id independence (`"acct:1"` vs `"acct:2"`); `state`/`events` for unknown id → `nil`/`[]`; a 7-command replay asserts final balance 0 and exact 6-event `:type` sequence.
- **Variations**: none present. **Subtasks**: none present.
- **Notable**: canonical template the other three 012 families clone verbatim (same store shape, same execute/state/events plumbing).

### 012_002_subscription_lifecycle_event_sourced_aggregate — Subscription Lifecycle Aggregate
- **Interface** (`SubscriptionAggregate`): commands `{:create, plan_name}`, `{:activate}`, `{:suspend, reason}`, `{:cancel}`, `{:reactivate}`; state `%{plan, status, reason}` | `nil`; status FSM `pending → active → suspended → cancelled → (reactivate) active`.
- **Approach**: same store/execute skeleton; `validate_command` pattern-matches on `%{status: …}`. Events `:subscription_created|_activated|_suspended|_cancelled|_reactivated`. `apply_event` transitions status and sets/clears `:reason` (suspend stores reason, cancel/reactivate reset it to `nil`).
- **Key invariants tested**: create-twice → `:already_exists`; any command pre-create → `:not_found`; activate when not pending → `:not_pending`; suspend when not active → `:not_active`; cancel-when-cancelled → `:already_cancelled`; reactivate when not cancelled → `:not_cancelled`; cancel from suspended succeeds; 7-command replay asserts final `:cancelled`/`reason: nil` and exact event sequence.
- **Variations**: none present. **Subtasks**: none present.
- **Notable**: solution adds a rule the prompt never specifies — `validate_command(%{status: :pending}, {:cancel})` returns `{:error, :not_active}` (prompt only mandated `:already_cancelled` for cancel); untested by the harness but a divergence to be aware of.

### 012_003_inventory_stock_event_sourced_aggregate — Inventory Stock Aggregate
- **Interface** (`InventoryAggregate`): commands `{:register, name, sku}`, `{:receive_stock, qty}`, `{:ship_stock, qty}`, `{:adjust, qty}`; state `%{name, sku, quantity_on_hand, status: :registered}` | `nil`.
- **Approach**: identical skeleton; events `:product_registered` (carries `name`+`sku`), `:stock_received`, `:stock_shipped`, `:stock_adjusted` (all carry `:quantity`). `apply_event` +/- `quantity_on_hand`.
- **Key invariants tested**: re-register → `:already_registered`; pre-register commands → `:not_registered`; non-positive receive/ship qty → `:invalid_quantity`; over-ship → `:insufficient_stock` (qty unchanged); `:adjust` allows negative but rejects **zero** (`:invalid_quantity`) and rejects a negative that would drive `quantity_on_hand` below 0 (`:insufficient_stock`); 7-command replay lands at 0 with exact 6-event sequence.
- **Variations**: none present. **Subtasks**: none present.
- **Notable**: `:adjust` is the only signed command — validation is `quantity == 0` and `state.quantity_on_hand + quantity < 0`.

### 012_004_task_tracker_event_sourced_aggregate — Task/Issue Tracker Aggregate
- **Interface** (`TaskAggregate`): commands `{:create, title, priority}` (`priority in [:low,:medium,:high]`, module attr `@valid_priorities`), `{:assign, assignee}`, `{:start}`, `{:complete}`, `{:reopen}`; state `%{title, assignee, status, priority}` | `nil`; status FSM `created → in_progress → completed → (reopen) created` with `assignee` reset to `nil` on create/reopen.
- **Approach**: same skeleton; events `:task_created` (title+priority), `:task_assigned` (assignee), `:task_started`, `:task_completed`, `:task_reopened`. `validate_command` clauses order matters (e.g. `%{assignee: nil}, {:start}` → `:not_assigned` before `%{status: :in_progress}` → `:already_started`).
- **Key invariants tested**: create-twice → `:already_exists`; bad priority (`:urgent`) → `:invalid_priority`; assign after complete → `:already_completed`; start without assignee → `:not_assigned`; start when in_progress → `:already_started`; complete when not in_progress → `:not_in_progress`; reopen when not completed → `:not_completed`; reopen resets to `:created` + `assignee: nil`; reassign allowed; 8-command replay asserts final assignee `"Diana"`/`:completed` and exact event sequence.
- **Variations**: none present. **Subtasks**: none present.
- **Notable**: test harness carries an explicit `# FIXED: Re-opening an in-progress task must return :not_completed` comment (line 220) — evidence of a previously-corrected bug where reopen from `:in_progress` misbehaved; the only 012 family with an enum-validated field (`priority`).

## Groups 013 + 014 + 015 — Retry Workers, Priority Queues, Monitors

Three families of stateful OTP `GenServer` components exercising async scheduling, deterministic time via an injected `:clock` function, and callback/notification hooks. All solutions are single-file, OTP-stdlib-only (no deps). Every family shares the same testing idiom: a fake `Clock` Agent (`now/advance/set`), injected `:random`/`:notify`/`processor`/`check_func` functions, and step-through synchronization (`send` + `assert_receive`, or a `drain`/`status` call to flush the mailbox). Each group has one original (`_001`) plus three sibling problem-variations (`_002/_003/_004`), all at subtask `_01` (full single-shot, each WITH its own `test_harness.exs`); there are NO fill-in-the-middle (`d=02+`) subtasks in this cluster. Directory layout is `a_b_c_d` where `b` is the variation index — so within each group the four dirs are genuinely different problems, not paraphrases.

### tasks/013_* — Retry Workers (exponential backoff family)
- **Interface (013_001 `RetryWorker`)**: `start_link(opts)` accepting `:clock` (0-arity ms, default `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)`), `:random` (1-arity `max -> 0..max-1`, default `:rand.uniform(max)-1`), `:name`. `execute(server, func, opts) :: {:ok, any} | {:error, :max_retries_exceeded, last_reason}` where `func` is 0-arity returning `{:ok, r}`/`{:error, reason}`; opts `:max_retries`(3), `:base_delay_ms`(100), `:max_delay_ms`(10_000).
- **Approach**: `execute` is a blocking `GenServer.call(..., :infinity)`; server replies asynchronously via `GenServer.reply/2`. `handle_call` runs `func` synchronously in the GenServer, then either replies or schedules `Process.send_after(self(), {:retry, func, attempt, opts, from}, total_wait)`. Delay = `min(base_delay <<< min(n,50), max_delay)` (`import Bitwise`, `n = next_attempt-1`) plus `jitter = random.(delay)`; `total_wait = delay + jitter`. State is minimal (`%{clock, random}`) — the `from`/func/attempt travel inside the timer message, so concurrent executes are independent without per-call bookkeeping. Note: `func` runs in-process, so a slow `func` DOES block other callers; only the *wait* is non-blocking.
- **Key invariants tested**: immediate success = no retry (Counter==1); `max_retries: 0` ⇒ exactly 1 call; exhaustion returns `{:error, :max_retries_exceeded, last_reason}`; exact delay schedule 100/200/400/800 with `ZeroRandom` (jitter 0); `max_delay_ms:300` caps at 100/200/300/300/300; fixed jitter=50 ⇒ wait 150; concurrent fast-vs-slow don't block; last error reason propagates. Delays verified by recording `Clock.now()` per attempt into a named ETS table while advancing the fake clock between `assert_receive {:attempt_done, n}` steps (real `base_delay_ms: 1` so wall-clock is instant, logical time driven by Agent clock).
- **Variations (3)**: `013_002 TimeoutRetryWorker` — adds `:attempt_timeout_ms`(5000); each attempt runs in `Task.async` guarded by `Task.yield/2` + `Task.shutdown(:brutal_kill)`; timeout ⇒ `{:error, :timeout}` retry; also handles `{ref, result}`/`{:DOWN,...}` and tracks a `tasks` map (yield is synchronous, so it blocks the server up to the timeout). `013_003 BudgetRetryWorker` — total wall-clock `:budget_ms`(30_000) instead of max_retries; **decorrelated (AWS) jitter**: `:random` is 2-arity `(min,max)`, `next_delay = random(base_delay, prev_delay*3)`, `capped = min(next_delay, max_delay)`, refuses retry if `elapsed + capped > budget`; returns `{:error, :budget_exhausted, reason, attempts}`. `013_004 ClassifiedRetryWorker` — three-shape return `{:ok,_}`/`{:error,:transient,reason}`/`{:error,:permanent,reason}`; permanent stops immediately; exhaustion ⇒ `{:error, :retries_exhausted, reason}`; optional 3-arity `:on_retry.(attempt, reason, delay)` fired in-process before scheduling.
- **Notable**: `013_003` solution deviates from its own prompt — instead of `Process.send_after`, it does `spawn_link` + a **busy-wait** `await_clock/2` loop (`receive after 0 -> recurse`) polling the injected clock; retry loop is a recursive `do_attempt/9`. All others use the `<<<` bit-shift for `2^N`.

### tasks/014_* — Priority Queue Processors
- **Interface (014_001 `PriorityQueue`)**: `start_link(opts)` with `:name`, `:processor` (1-arity, default identity). `enqueue(server, task, priority)` with `priority in [:high,:normal,:low]` ⇒ `:ok`. `status/1 :: %{high:, normal:, low:}` (pending only, not the in-flight task). `drain/1` blocks until idle+empty (`:infinity`). `processed/1 :: [{task, result}]` in completion order.
- **Approach**: three `:queue` (Erlang FIFO) in `state.queues` keyed by level; `pop_highest` scans `[:high,:normal,:low]` via `Enum.find_value`. Async single-worker loop: `enqueue` → `maybe_trigger_processing` sends `:process_next` only if idle; `handle_info(:process_next)` `spawn_monitor`s the processor, which `send`s `{:task_result, self(), result}` back; on `{:DOWN, ref, ...}` it records the result and either re-triggers `:process_next` or flips `processing: false` and replies to queued `drain_waiters`. Only one task runs at a time; `processing` boolean gates triggering.
- **Key invariants tested**: FIFO within a level; strict `:high > :normal > :low` (tests use a "gate" process the processor blocks on so tasks pile up deterministically, then `Process.exit(gate, :kill)` releases them); `status` counts exclude the running task; `drain` on empty returns immediately; 50 concurrent `Task.async` enqueues lose nothing.
- **Variations (3)**: `014_002 ExpiringPriorityQueue` — per-task TTL; `enqueue(server, task, priority, opts)` with `:ttl_ms` (default `:default_ttl_ms`=5000), entries stored as `{task, expires_at}` using injected `:clock`; `pop_next_valid` recursively skips expired entries into an `expired` list; adds `expired/1` and `status.expired`. `014_003 CancellablePriorityQueue` — **numeric** priorities (0 = highest, dynamic `%{priority => :queue}` map, `Enum.sort` on keys); `enqueue ⇒ {:ok, ref}` (`make_ref/0`), `cancel(server, ref) :: :ok | {:error, :not_found}` (removes pending only, via `find_and_remove` + `clean_empty_queues`), `peek/1 :: {:ok, task, priority} | :empty`, `status` has `%{pending, by_priority, cancelled}`. `014_004 ConcurrentPriorityQueue` — `:max_concurrency`(1, validated pos int); levels renamed `:critical > :normal > :low`; tracks `active_workers` (`pid => {task, ref}`) and `pending_results` (result buffered on `{:task_result}`, finalized on `{:DOWN}`); `status` adds `active`/`max_concurrency`; completion order may differ from start order.
- **Notable**: all four run the processor in a `spawn_monitor`ed child (async), despite `014_001`'s prompt saying "called synchronously inside handle_info"; `{:task_result}` and `{:DOWN}` are decoupled so the result arrives before the monitor-down finalizes it. `drain` implemented by parking callers in `drain_waiters` and replying on quiescence.

### tasks/015_* — Service Monitors
- **Interface (015_001 `Monitor`)**: `start_link(opts)` with `:clock`, `:name`, `:notify` (`fn name, reason -> _` fired on `:down` transition). `register(server, name, check_func, interval_ms, max_failures \\ 3) :: :ok | {:error, :already_registered}`; `check_func` 0-arity ⇒ `:ok | {:error, reason}`. `status(server, name) :: {:ok, %{status: :up|:down|:pending, last_check_at, consecutive_failures}} | {:error, :not_found}`. `statuses/1`, `deregister/2` (idempotent `:ok`).
- **Approach**: `state = %{services: %{}, clock, notify}`; each service record holds `check_func, interval_ms, max_failures, status, last_check_at, consecutive_failures, notified_down`. Registration schedules `Process.send_after(self(), {:check, name}, interval_ms)`; `handle_info({:check, name})` looks the service up (missing ⇒ silently discard, which is how deregister cancels timers), runs `check_func` in-process, applies result, then re-schedules. `apply_check_result`: `:ok` ⇒ status `:up`, failures 0, `notified_down: false`; `{:error, r}` ⇒ increment, and at `failures >= max_failures` set `:down`; `notify?` is `threshold_reached && !notified_down` (exactly-once per down-run, re-armed on recovery via the reset flag).
- **Key invariants tested**: starts `:pending`; no double-register; `:up` after success; `:down` exactly at Nth consecutive failure; notify fires once, not on subsequent failures; custom `max_failures`; recover `:down`→`:up`; re-arm notify after recovery (`[{"api",:crash},{"api",:oom}]`); a success mid-run resets the counter; deregister removes + a stale `{:check, name}` is a no-op (0 notifications); re-register after deregister; per-service independence; `last_check_at` tracks clock; notify carries the *final* failure's reason. Tests drive checks manually via `trigger_check` (`send(mon, {:check, name})` then a `status` call to synchronize).
- **Variations (3)**: `015_002 RateMonitor` — rolling-window failure *rate* instead of consecutive count; `register(..., opts)` with `:window_size`(5)/`:threshold`(0.6); bounded `history` of `:ok`/`:error` (`Enum.take(-window_size)`); `:down` only when `window_full && rate >= threshold`; `status_info` has `:failure_rate`/`:checks_in_window`; `:notify.(name, failure_rate)`. `015_003 AsyncMonitor` — each check runs in a spawned `Task.start` with `:timeout_ms`(5000) via a separate `Process.send_after {:check_timeout, name, ref}`; task sends `{:check_result, name, ref, result}`; on timeout `Process.exit(pid, :kill)` ⇒ `{:error, :timeout}`; stale-`ref` results discarded; `status_info.check_in_flight`; one task per service; deregister kills in-flight task. `015_004 ManagedMonitor` — adds pause/resume + maintenance windows; internal split of `mode :: :active|:paused|:maintenance` vs `health :: :pending|:up|:down`; reported `status` is `:paused`/`:maintenance` overlay else `health`; `pause` skips check execution (timer still fires), `maintenance(server, name, duration_ms)` runs checks but suppresses failure counting/`:down` (successes still recover), auto-expires via `{:maintenance_end, name}`; `:notify` is 3-arity `(name, event, detail)` for `:down`/`:recovered`/`:maintenance_started`/`:maintenance_ended`; `resume` returns `{:error, :not_paused}` when active.
- **Notable**: uniform "look up service in map; if absent, drop the message" pattern is how all four cancel timers without holding timer refs. `015_003` also `try/rescue/catch`-wraps the check to convert exceptions to `{:error, {:exception, msg}}` and monitors the task but ignores `{:DOWN,...}` (lifecycle driven by result/timeout messages). Only `015_001`/`015_004` have `max_failures` as a positional 5th arg; `015_002`/`015_003` take it (or window opts) via a trailing `opts` keyword list.

## Groups 031–034 — Data Import, Ecto Ingestion & Log Analysis

Self-contained file-processing tasks: parse/validate tabular or line-delimited data (CSV/JSONL/JSON/logfmt), bulk-ingest into Ecto, or fold a structured file into an analysis report. Common thread: split good records from bad without ever raising, return a `{:ok, result}` / `{:error, reason}` shape, and cover the same edge-case surface (missing file, empty file, malformed rows, header/blank handling, quoted fields, BOM). All 13 directories are `d=01` full single-shot tasks that ship a `test_harness.exs`; there are **no fill-in-the-middle subtasks (`d=02+`)** in this cluster, and the `b=001..004` dirs are *distinct problems* in each family, not trivial rewordings. External deps used: `:nimble_csv` (031/032 CSV), `Jason` (JSONL/JSON), `Ecto` + `Ecto.Adapters.SQLite3` (032 test repos). Pure-stdlib only for 034. No OTP/GenServer/Agent/ETS anywhere except 032_003's `Task.async_stream` for parallel batches; no injected clocks (timestamps taken from `NaiveDateTime.utc_now/0`, tests `Process.sleep(2000)` to force >1s separation).

### tasks/031_* — CSV/JSONL/logfmt Importers with Schema Validation
- **Interface (per variation):** all expose a file+string pair returning `{:ok, valid, error_report} | {:error, :file_not_found | :empty_file}`, where `error_report` is `[{row_or_line_number, field_name, error_message}]` (1-based data rows/lines).
  - 031_001 `CsvImporter.import_file/2` & `import_string/2` — valid rows are `%{header_string => trimmed_string_value}`.
  - 031_002 `JsonlImporter.import_file/2` & `import_string/2` — one JSON object per line; valid records keep decoded values; adds `:list` type.
  - 031_003 `CsvLoader.load_file/2` & `load_string/2` — **coerces** values to native Elixir types; valid rows are **atom-keyed** (`:key` field or `String.to_atom(name)`) with typed values; extra types `:date`, `:enum` (needs `:values`).
  - 031_004 `LogfmtValidator.validate_file/2` & `validate_string/2` + public `parse_logfmt_line/1` — space-separated `key=value`, quoted values, bare keys → `"true"`.
- **Approach:** shared schema = list of field maps `%{name, required (default true), type (default :string), format}`; `:format` accepts a `Regex` or atom `:email` (permissive regex `~r/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`). 031_001/003 use `NimbleCSV.define(<Mod>.Parser, separator: ",", escape: "\"")`; single-pass `Enum.reduce` accumulating `{valid, errors}`. 031_004 is a **hand-written recursive parser** (`do_parse/2`, `parse_key`, `parse_value`) — deliberately does *not* `trim_leading` after `=` so a leading space means empty value.
- **Key invariants tested:** all validation errors reported per field (not first-only); exact messages `"is required"`, `"must be a valid <type>"`, `"does not match expected format"`; type rules — integer via `Integer.parse` w/ `{_,""}`, float accepts integer-formatted strings, boolean ∈ `~w(true false 1 0)` case-insensitive; row shorter than header → missing cols empty, longer → extras dropped; required checks whitespace-only as empty; type/format checks skipped on empty values; UTF-8 BOM `\xEF\xBB\xBF` stripped; header-only file → `{:ok, [], []}`; whitespace trimmed; quoted commas/newlines survive; 500-row scale test (031_001).
- **Variations:** 4 (csv importer / jsonl importer / csv loader+coercion / logfmt validator) — see interfaces above.
- **Subtasks:** none.
- **Notable:** 031_001 guards NimbleCSV (raises on empty) with a manual `String.split(~r/\r?\n/, parts: 2)` pre-check for the header-only case; valid-row map filtered to schema fields actually present in headers.

### tasks/032_* — File → Ecto Bulk/Batch Ingestion Pipelines
- **Interface:** `<Mod>.ingest(repo, schema, file_path, opts \\ [])` → `{:ok, stats}` | `{:error, reason}`; stats is an integer-keyed map (keys differ by variation).
  - 032_001 `DataIngestion` — JSON array file; `stats = %{total, inserted, updated, failed}`.
  - 032_002 `CsvIngestion` — CSV via NimbleCSV, each row validated through an **Ecto changeset**; `stats = %{total, inserted, invalid, failed}` (`:invalid` = changeset-rejected).
  - 032_003 `JsonlIngestion` — `File.stream!/1` line-by-line + `Jason.decode/1`, **optional parallelism**; `stats = %{total, inserted, skipped, failed}`.
  - 032_004 `MultiSchemaIngestion.ingest(repo, routing, file_path, opts)` — `routing = %{type_string => schema_module}`; `stats = %{total, by_schema: %{schema => %{inserted, failed}}, unroutable, missing_type}`.
- **Approach:** `with`-chain: `read_file` → `parse` → validate top-level list → `Enum.chunk_every(batch_size)` → `repo.insert_all/3` per batch inside `try/rescue/catch` (a failing batch adds its size to `:failed`/`:invalid` and continues — partial success is still `{:ok, stats}`). `prepare_rows` filters JSON string keys to `schema.__schema__(:fields)` (compared as strings, atomised via `String.to_existing_atom` — never `to_atom` on untrusted input) and injects `inserted_at`/`updated_at` (since `insert_all` skips callbacks/timestamps). insert vs update told apart via `returning: true` + comparing returned `inserted_at`/`updated_at` within `@insert_window_seconds = 1`. `require Logger`; `Logger.info` after each batch with running totals.
- **Opts:** `:batch_size` (default 500), `:on_conflict` (default `:replace_all`), `:conflict_target` (default `:nothing`), `:returning` (default true, 032_001); 032_003 adds `:max_concurrency` (default 1) + `:timeout` and switches to `Task.async_stream(..., max_concurrency:, timeout:)` when `>1`; 032_004 adds `:type_field` (default `"type"`) and per-schema `conflict_target` map, groups via `Enum.group_by` on the discriminator.
- **Key invariants tested:** `{:error, :file_not_found | :invalid_json | :not_a_list}`; empty array → all-zero stats; batch boundaries honored (e.g. batch_size 5 with a NOT-NULL-violating middle batch → `failed: 5`, others still inserted); upsert path (`on_conflict: {:replace_all_except, [:inserted_at]}`) yields `updated >= 5`. Tests spin an in-memory SQLite repo (`:memory:`), `CREATE TABLE widgets` with `external_id UNIQUE`, `async: false`.
- **Variations:** 4 (json bulk / csv+changeset / jsonl streaming+parallel / multi-table discriminator routing).
- **Subtasks:** none.
- **Notable:** 032_001 `get_ts/2` reads either atom- or string-keyed returned rows; timestamp-window trick is the load-bearing mechanism for insert/update classification and is why the upsert test sleeps 2s.

### tasks/033_* — Structured File Analyzers (log / metrics / HTTP / financial)
- **Interface:** one public fn, `<Mod>.analyze/1` (033_002 is `summarize/1`), `(path) → {:ok, report_map} | {:error, reason}`. Report is a plain map with a fixed key set.
  - 033_001 `LogAnalyzer.analyze/1` → `%{counts_by_level, error_rate, top_errors, time_range, errors_per_hour, malformed_count}`.
  - 033_002 `MetricAggregator.summarize/1` → `%{per_metric: %{name => %{count,min,max,sum,mean}}, total_samples, time_range, samples_per_hour, unique_tags: %{tag_key => MapSet}, malformed_count}`.
  - 033_003 `AccessLogAnalyzer.analyze/1` → `%{requests_by_method, requests_by_status, top_paths, avg_duration, max_duration, error_rate, error_count, time_range, malformed_count}` (error = status ≥ 400).
  - 033_004 `TransactionAnalyzer.analyze/1` → `%{balance_by_account, volume_by_currency, transaction_count, top_accounts, time_range, malformed_count}` (`type ∈ {"credit","debit"}`, `amount > 0`).
- **Approach:** `File.stat(path)` first for a clean `{:error, reason}` (since `File.stream!/3` is lazy), then `File.stream!([], :line)` → trim `\n`/`\r` → `Enum.reduce(initial_acc/0, &process_line/2)` → `build_report/1`. Each line is an independent JSON object decoded by `Jason.decode/1`; single streaming pass keeps counts, min/max timestamps `{min_dt,max_dt}`, per-hour buckets keyed `{{y,m,d}, hour}` (UTC). `top_*` sorted **descending by count, then ascending by key alphabetically**, `Enum.take(10)`.
- **Key invariants tested (033_001 fixture):** counts per level exact; `error_rate = errors / valid_lines` (5/9); `malformed_count` counts bad-JSON + missing-field lines (2) but **blank/whitespace lines skipped silently, not malformed**; `top_errors` tie broken alphabetically, capped at 10 distinct; `time_range` earliest/latest across all valid lines (`nil` if none); `errors_per_hour` only hours with ≥1 error, spans calendar days. Timestamp parse via `DateTime.from_iso8601/1` then `DateTime.shift_zone!(dt, "Etc/UTC")`; malformed if not a JSON object, any required field absent, or timestamp unparseable/non-string.
- **Variations:** 4 (log levels / numeric metrics stats / HTTP traffic / financial ledger) — same streaming skeleton, different accumulators and report keys.
- **Subtasks:** none.
- **Notable:** identical fold-over-stream architecture reused across all four; 033_003 classifies via `status_code >= 400`; 033_002 accumulates running `%{count,min,max,sum}` then derives `:mean = sum/count` at report time.

### tasks/034_001 — Data Reconciliation Engine
- **Interface:** `Reconciler.reconcile(left, right, opts)` (both lists of maps, `opts` keyword) → `%{matched: [%{left, right, differences}], only_in_left: [record], only_in_right: [record]}`. `differences` is `%{field => %{left: val, right: val}}` (empty if equal on all compared fields).
- **Opts:** `:key_fields` (**required**, non-empty list of atoms; validated via `fetch_key_fields!` which raises `ArgumentError` on missing/non-list/non-atom) forming a **composite key**; `:compare_fields` (optional; defaults to `(keys(left) ∪ keys(right)) − key_fields`).
- **Approach:** pure/stdlib only, no processes. `index_by/2` builds `%{composite_key_tuple => record}` where key is `key_fields |> Enum.map(&Map.get) |> List.to_tuple()` (1-tuple even for single key, avoids collisions); set algebra on `MapSet` of keys → intersection/difference gives matched/only-left/only-right; `diff/3` folds fields comparing with `==`, missing field treated as `nil`.
- **Key invariants tested:** exact + composite-key matching (`[:org_id,:user_id]` matches only when both equal); matched entries carry **full original left/right** even when `compare_fields` excludes fields; identical records → `differences == %{}`; a field present on one side only → `%{field => %{left: v, right: nil}}`; empty/disjoint lists; result order irrelevant.
- **Variations:** 1 (only 001). **Subtasks:** none.
- **Notable:** duplicate keys resolved last-write-wins (documented as intentional for the side-effect-free contract).

## Groups 035–045 — Data Transforms & ETS-Backed Modules

Eleven single-shot tasks (all `_01`, each with prompt.md + solution.ex + test_harness.exs; **no `_02+` variations and no fill-in-the-middle subtasks exist in this range**). Families 035–040 are pure, dependency-free data-transformation modules (single public function, no processes); families 041–045 are OTP modules where a GenServer owns one or more `:named_table` ETS tables and the "hot path" (reads / atomic counters) bypasses the process by hitting ETS directly, while mutations serialise through `GenServer.call`. Recurring design idioms: deterministic-without-a-clock (monotonic integer counter in 041; SHA-256/`phash2` hashing in 037/045), `:persistent_term` used to publish the server pid / ETS tid so public functions avoid a GenServer round-trip (042, 045), and lazy `:ets.new` on first use (042). Stdlib/OTP only, no external deps anywhere.

### 035_001_time_series_resampler — Time Series Resampler
- **Interface**: `TimeSeriesResampler.resample(data, interval_ms, opts \\ []) :: [{bucket_start_ms, value | nil}]`. `data` = `[{ts_ms, number}]` any order; `opts` = `[agg: mode, fill: mode]`.
- **Approach**: sort by ts; bucket = `div(ts, interval) * interval` (`floor_bucket`); `Enum.group_by` into buckets; walk grid with `Stream.iterate(&(&1+interval)) |> take_while(<= last_bucket)` and `Enum.map_reduce` carrying `last_value` for forward-fill. `:agg` ∈ `[:last, :first, :mean, :sum, :count, :max, :min]` (default `:last`); `:fill` ∈ `[:nil, :forward]` (default `:nil`). `resample([], …) → []`.
- **Key invariants tested**: every bucket between first & last present even if empty; boundary point at exact `interval` goes to the higher bucket; reverse-order input == sorted input; `:forward` carries last non-empty agg value (nil if leading gap); `:mean` is float via `sum/count`.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `@valid_fill [:nil, :forward]` — tests pass `fill: nil` which works because `:nil == nil` in Elixir. Raises `ArgumentError` for non-positive/non-integer `interval_ms` or bad opt values (`fetch_opt!`).

### 036_001_markdown_to_structured_data_parser — Markdown → Structured Data
- **Interface**: `MarkdownParser.parse(markdown :: binary) :: [%{category: String.t(), items: [%{name, description, tags}]}]`.
- **Approach**: `split("\n") → trim_trailing → classify_line → reduce`. Two module regexes: heading `~r/^##\s+(.+)$/`, item `~r/^-\s+\*\*(.+?)\*\*:\s+(.*?)(?:\s+\(([^)]*)\))?\s*$/` (bold name, description, optional trailing `(tags)`). Fold with state `%{categories, current}`; items prepended then `Enum.reverse` in `finalise`.
- **Key invariants tested**: only H2 defines categories (H1/H3+ ignored as unrecognized); empty H2 → `items: []`; bullets before first heading discarded; tags split on `,` + individually trimmed + empty rejected (no parens → `[]`); nested/indented `  -` and non-bold bullets ignored; CRLF handled (trim_trailing strips `\r`); `parse("") → []`.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: single-`-`-only match enforced by regex anchor `^-\s+`.

### 037_001_data_anonymizer — Data Anonymizer
- **Interface**: `Anonymizer.anonymize(records :: [map], rules :: %{atom => rule}) :: [map]`. `rule` ∈ `:hash | :mask | :redact | {:fake, seed}`.
- **Approach**: `Enum.map` records, per record `Enum.reduce(rules, …)` applying `apply_rule/2`; missing field silently skipped (`Map.fetch` → `:error` passes through). `:hash` = `:crypto.hash(:sha256, to_string(v)) |> Base.encode16(case: :lower)`; `:mask` keeps first+last, middle → `*` (len 0 unchanged, 1 → `"*"`, 2 → as-is); `:redact` → `"[REDACTED]"`; `{:fake, seed}` = `generate_fake` hashes `"#{inspect(seed)}:#{value}"` with SHA-256, uses successive bytes b0..b6 to index `@first_names`/`@last_names`/`@domains` word-lists and pick one of 4 output formats (`rem(b2,4)`).
- **Key invariants tested**: referential integrity for all 4 rules (same value → same output, driven by purity of hashing); different seeds / different values → different fakes; untouched fields passthrough; empty records → `[]`; empty rules → unchanged.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: determinism achieved purely via hashing (no RNG/clock). No external Faker dependency — hand-rolled word lists.

### 038_001_tree_structure_builder_from_flat_list — Tree Builder from Flat List
- **Interface**: `TreeBuilder.build(items, opts \\ []) :: {:ok, forest} | {:error, {:cycle_detected, ids}}`. Nodes are `%{id, parent_id, ...}`; output adds `:children`. Opt `:orphan_strategy` ∈ `:discard` (default) | `:raise_to_root`.
- **Approach**: `index_items` (id→node map + ordered id list); `detect_duplicate_ids` (returns `{:error, {:duplicate_ids, dupes}}`); `build_children_map` (parent_id → child ids in input order via `++`); **iterative-ish white/grey/black DFS `detect_cycle`/`dfs`** with `extract_cycle` reconstructing cycle ids top-down from the ancestor stack; roots = nodes with `nil` parent_id OR (unknown parent_id AND strategy `:raise_to_root`); `build_subtree` recurses.
- **Key invariants tested**: direct (A→B→A) & indirect (A→B→C→A) cycles detected, ids reported; no false positives on deep chains (1..20), wide fans (50 siblings), diamonds; children & roots preserve input order; all original fields preserved; child-first input still builds; string/atom/int ids; orphans discarded vs raised (raised orphan keeps its own subtree).
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: cycle detection runs on the `parent→children` graph before any tree construction. `:children` key is only added, never a full node rebuild.

### 039_001_diff_generator_for_record_lists — Diff Generator for Record Lists
- **Interface**: `RecordDiff.diff(old_list, new_list, opts \\ []) :: %{added: [rec], removed: [rec], changed: [entry]}`. Opt `:key` (default `:id`). `entry = %{<key> => key_value, changes: %{field => {old, new}}}`.
- **Approach**: `index_by` both lists into `%{key_value => record}` (`Map.fetch!` on key); MapSet diff/intersection on key sets; `map_set_to_records` **sorts keys** for deterministic order; `changed_entries` compares via `diff_records` (union of both records' keys, `Map.get(…, :missing)` for absent side, drops equal fields); identical records omitted.
- **Key invariants tested**: identical/empty → all-empty diff; added/removed/disjoint sets; multi-field changes; unchanged records excluded from `:changed`; field added → `{:missing, new}`, removed → `{old, :missing}`; custom `:key` (`:uuid`); mixed add+remove+change scenario. Pure — no processes.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `:missing` atom is the sentinel for field presence changes; determinism via `Enum.sort` on keys.

### 040_001_configuration_merger_with_override_rules — Configuration Merger
- **Interface**: `ConfigMerger.merge(base, override, opts \\ []) :: map`. Opts: `:list_strategy` ∈ `:replace` (default) | `:append`; `:list_strategies` = `%{key_path => strategy}`; `:locked` = `[key_path]`. Key paths are lists of atoms (root→target), e.g. `[:app, :auth, :secret_key]`.
- **Approach**: `resolve_opts` validates & normalises (accepts both list `[:a,:b]` and tuple `{:a,:b}` paths via `normalise_path`); `do_merge` unions keys, tracks `current_path`, `cond`: base-only kept, override-only added, else lock check then `merge_values`. `merge_values`: map+map → recurse; list+list → `list_strategy_for` (per-key beats global) `:replace`→override / `:append`→`base ++ override`; else override wins (scalars, type mismatch).
- **Key invariants tested**: scalar override; deep 3–4 level merge preserves untouched branches; list replace default vs append (global & per-key & nested paths); locked top-level & nested keys keep base value; lock at one path doesn't protect same key name elsewhere; multiple locks; append+lock combined; empty override → base, empty base → override.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: raises `ArgumentError` on bad strategy value or malformed path. Locking only applies when key exists in both maps.

### 041_001_lru_cache_backed_by_ets — LRU Cache Backed by ETS
- **Interface** (GenServer): `start_link(name:, max_size:)` (both required); `get(name, key) :: {:ok, value} | :miss`; `put(name, key, value) :: :ok`. Provides `child_spec/1`.
- **Approach**: **two ETS tables** — `:"#{name}_data"` (`:set, :public, read_concurrency`) `key → {value, ts}` for O(1) reads, and `:"#{name}_order"` (`:ordered_set, :protected`) `ts → key` for O(log n) eviction. **Monotonic integer `counter` in state = the "timestamp"** (no wall clock → deterministic). `get` reads ETS directly then `GenServer.call({:touch, key})` to refresh order (re-checks existence, deletes old ts row, inserts new). `put` via call: existing key updates value + ts; new key runs `maybe_evict` (if `:ets.info(size) >= max_size`, evict `:ets.first(order_table)` = smallest ts = LRU) then inserts. `next_counter` increments.
- **Key invariants tested**: `:miss` on unknown; overwrite; LRU eviction order; **`get` promotes to MRU** (saves entry from eviction); `put` on existing key refreshes recency; size-1 cache; arbitrary terms incl `nil` key/value; two instances independent (unique per-test names).
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: explicitly clock-free by design (prompt calls it out). Tests `async: false`.

### 042_001_ets_based_write_through_cache_layer — Write-Through Cache Layer
- **Interface** (GenServer): `start_link(opts \\ [])`; `fetch(server, table, key, fallback_fn) :: {:ok, value}`; `invalidate(server, table, key) :: :ok`; `invalidate_all(server, table) :: :ok`. `table` = atom, `fallback_fn` = 0-arity.
- **Approach**: one ETS `:set, :public` table per `table` atom, created **lazily** in `ensure_table` on first `:fetch`. Tid published via `:persistent_term.put({CacheLayer, self(), table}, tid)`; `fetch` resolves server→pid (`resolve_pid!` via `GenServer.whereis`), reads that persistent_term then hits ETS directly on hit. **Cache miss → `GenServer.call({:fetch, …})` which re-checks ETS then calls `fallback_fn.()` at-most-once**, inserts result. `terminate/2` (traps exits) deletes tables + erases persistent_term entries.
- **Key invariants tested**: miss calls fallback once & stores; hit doesn't recall; fallback value stored/returned; `nil` is a valid cached value (no re-call); invalidate single key re-triggers fallback, leaves others; `invalidate_all` clears table; invalidate/invalidate_all on absent key/table → `:ok`; table namespaces independent (same key diff table = 2 misses); lazy creation. Test uses an `Agent` `CallTracker` to count fallback invocations.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: at-most-once guarantee comes from the GenServer re-checking ETS under serialisation. Unnamed ETS tables (tids tracked in state) to avoid cross-instance atom collisions.

### 043_001_ets_based_leaderboard — ETS-Based Leaderboard
- **Interface** (no GenServer — pure ETS): `new(board_name :: atom) :: {:ok, board}`; `submit_score(board, player_id, score) :: :ok`; `top(board, n) :: [{player_id, score}]`; `rank(board, player_id) :: {:ok, rank, score} | {:error, :not_found}`.
- **Approach**: `:ets.new(name, [:set, :public, :named_table, read_concurrency])` → tid is the `board`. `submit_score` uses **`:ets.insert_new` fast path** (fresh key), else atomic conditional overwrite via `:ets.select_replace` with match spec guarding `{:>, score, :"$1"}` (keep personal best; float-safe, avoids `update_counter`). `top` = `tab2list |> sort_by(score, :desc) |> take(n)` (`top(_,0)→[]`). `rank` looks up player then `:ets.select_count` of players with strictly-greater score, `+1` = **standard competition ("1224") ranking**.
- **Key invariants tested**: empty top; desc sort; `top(n)` caps & returns all if fewer; higher score overwrites, lower/equal no-op; convergence to personal best; rank 1-based, ties share rank; not-found; player_id type independence (`"1"` vs `1` vs `:one`); board isolation; score 0 & negatives; 1000-player scale.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: concurrency achieved purely through atomic ETS ops (`insert_new`, `select_replace`) — no GenServer. Uses `:named_table` so second board needs distinct atom (tests use `unique_integer`).

### 044_001_ets_based_metrics_collector — ETS-Based Metrics Collector
- **Interface** (GenServer owns table only): `start_link(opts \\ [])` (`:name` default `__MODULE__`); `increment(name, amount \\ 1) :: :ok`; `gauge(name, value) :: :ok`; `get(name) :: number | nil`; `all() :: map`; `reset(name) :: :ok`; `snapshot() :: map`.
- **Approach**: single fixed table `@table __MODULE__` created in `init` as `[:set, :named_table, :public, read_concurrency: true, write_concurrency: true]`. **Hot path bypasses GenServer entirely** — `increment` = `:ets.update_counter(@table, name, {2, amount}, {name, 0})` (atomic, default row `{name,0}`); `gauge`/`reset` = `:ets.insert`; `get` = `:ets.lookup`; `all`/`snapshot` = `tab2list |> Map.new` (snapshot is just an alias for `all`, semantic-only).
- **Key invariants tested**: increment creates-at-1 / adds amount / defaults 1; reset → 0 for counter & gauge & unknown; gauge exact/overwrite/decrease/zero; get nil unknown; all/snapshot maps; snapshot is a point-in-time copy (later mutation doesn't change captured map); key independence; **100 concurrent `Task.async` increments == 100** (atomicity); mixed concurrent counters+gauges.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `increment` guard `is_integer(amount) and amount >= 0` (monotonic). Only OTP module here that never routes any operation through the process after init. Tests `async: false`, `start_supervised!(Metrics)`.

### 045_001_ets_based_feature_flag_store — ETS-Based Feature Flag Store
- **Interface** (GenServer): `start_link(opts \\ [])` (`:table_name` default `:feature_flags`, `:name` default `__MODULE__`, `name: nil` skips registration); `enable/1`, `disable/1`, `enable_for_percentage/2` (0..100 int); `enabled?/1 :: boolean`; `enabled_for?/2 :: boolean`.
- **Approach**: table created in `init` as `[:set, :named_table, :public, read_concurrency: true]`. **Writes serialise** through `handle_call({:set, flag, value})`; values stored as `{:on} | {:off} | {:percentage, n}`. **Reads hit ETS directly** (`lookup/1`). Server pid & table published via `:persistent_term` (`@pt_server`, `@pt_table`) so public write fns reach the server without a fixed registered name. Percentage bucket **deterministic** via `:erlang.phash2({flag_name, user_id}, 100) < pct`.
- **Key invariants tested**: unknown → false; enable/disable global; `enabled?` false for percentage flags; 0% none / 100% all; 50% ≈ half (400–600 of 1000); determinism (two passes equal); exact `phash2` formula match; state transitions on→percentage→off; percentage update takes effect immediately; flag independence; concurrent reads consistent.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `persistent_term`-based server discovery lets tests start with `name: nil`. Deterministic rollout via `phash2` (no RNG/clock). Tests `async: false`.

## Groups 061–075 — Concurrency, Saga & Testing Utilities

Ten self-contained single-file Elixir tasks split into two themes: hand-rolled OTP concurrency primitives (061–064) and testing/utility infrastructure (070–075). The concurrency tasks all reimplement scheduling/timeout/work-distribution logic from scratch (no `Task.async_stream`), stressing ordered results, crash isolation, and no-zombie guarantees. The testing utilities cover the Saga pattern plus ExMachina-style factories, injectable clocks, DB cleaners, custom ExUnit macros, and StreamData generators. Every family has ONLY the `_01` original single-shot dir (prompt.md + solution.ex + test_harness.exs); there are NO `b≥02` problem variations and NO `d≥02` fill-in-the-middle subtasks in this cluster. All solutions are stdlib/OTP-only except 075 (depends on `stream_data`) and 073/074 (assume Ecto types present, but tests use fakes).

### 061 — ParallelMap (parallel map with concurrency limit)
- **Interface**: `ParallelMap.pmap(collection, func, max_concurrency)` → results list in input order; per-element `{:error, reason}` on crash. Helper GenServer `ConcurrencyCounter` with `start_link(opts)` (accepts `:name`), `increment/1`, `decrement/1` (return new count), `peak/1` (highest ever). Guards: `is_function(func,1)`, `max_concurrency >= 1`.
- **Approach**: NOT `Task.async`; uses `spawn_monitor` so task crashes deliver only a `:DOWN` message, never propagate. Each spawned fn wraps `func.(elem)` in try/rescue/catch → sends `{our_ref, {:ok,val}|{:error,reason}}` to parent (own `make_ref()` as message key, monitor ref kept alongside). Seed = first `max_concurrency` elements via `Enum.split`; `collect/5` recursion awaits one result then refills the freed slot from the queue. `running` map `%{our_ref => {mon_ref, idx}}`; on result `Process.demonitor(mon_ref, [:flush])`. Reassembles via `Enum.map(0..total-1, &Map.fetch!(raw,&1))`.
- **Key invariants tested**: order preserved even when tasks finish out-of-order (later indices sleep less); `peak <= max_concurrency`; `peak >= 2` proves real parallelism; `max_concurrency=1` → peak exactly 1; single crash doesn't cancel siblings; all-crash returns all error tuples; empty collection → `[]`.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `await_one` also handles external `Process.exit(pid,:kill)` by locating the entry via monitor ref (`Enum.find`). `ConcurrencyCounter.decrement` intentionally does NOT touch peak. `async: false` test file.

### 062 — Pipeline (pipeline processor with stages)
- **Interface**: `Pipeline.new()` → `%Pipeline{stages: []}` (`@enforce_keys [:stages]`); `Pipeline.stage(pipeline, name, fun)` (name atom, `fun/1` → `{:ok,res}|{:error,reason}`, stored in insertion order via `stages ++ [{name,fun}]`); `Pipeline.run(pipeline, input)` → `{:ok, final, [%{stage: atom, duration_us: non_neg_integer}]}` or `{:error, failed_stage_name, reason}`.
- **Approach**: Pure module, no processes/GenServer. `execute/3` tail-recursion threading value + reversed meta accumulator. Per-stage timing via `:timer.tc(fn -> fun.(value) end)` (microseconds). On `{:error,reason}` halts immediately returning 3-tuple (metadata NOT returned on error). Invalid stage return (not ok/error tuple) raises `ArgumentError`.
- **Key invariants tested**: results thread correctly; metadata ordered by execution, one per executed stage; empty pipeline returns input unchanged with `[]`; stages after failure never called (Agent flag); sleeping stage → `duration_us >= 9_000` for 10ms sleep; works with map/list inputs.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `async: true`. Comment in code notes metadata is deliberately dropped from the error tuple to honor the strict 3-element spec.

### 063 — ConcurrentFetcher (concurrent data fetcher with global timeout)
- **Interface**: `ConcurrentFetcher.fetch_all(sources, timeout_ms)` where `sources :: [{name, zero_arity_fetch_fn}]`, name any term. Returns `%{name => {:ok,value}|{:error,:timeout}|{:error,reason}}`. Empty sources → `%{}` immediately. Guards: `is_list`, `is_integer(timeout_ms) and >= 0`.
- **Approach**: `Task.async/1` per source (linked to caller). `safe_call/1` normalizes fetch_fn return (`{:ok,_}|{:error,_}`, else `{:error,{:unexpected_return,other}}`) with rescue→`{:error,exception}` and catch→`{:error,{kind,value}}`. Single **global** budget via `Task.yield_many(tasks, timeout_ms)` (one shared wall-clock, not per-source). `nil` yield outcome → `Task.shutdown(task, :brutal_kill)` then `{:error,:timeout}`; `{:exit,reason}` → `{:error,reason}`. Result map built keyed by `task.ref` then re-keyed to source names.
- **Key invariants tested**: fast fetches ok, slow → `:timeout`; 400ms ok / 600ms timeout under 500ms budget semantics; returns within `timeout+200ms` even with a 10s fetch; **no zombie processes** (compares `Process.list()` MapSet before/after, `Process.sleep(50)` for teardown); genuine concurrency (5×100ms < 300ms); arbitrary term keys (string/int/tuple).
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `async: true`. Relies on `Task.shutdown` synchronously killing + reaping to guarantee no leftover pids.

### 064 — WorkStealQueue (work-stealing task queue)
- **Interface**: `WorkStealQueue.run(items, worker_count, process_fn)` → list of `%{item, result, worker_id: 0..worker_count-1}` (any order), synchronous/blocking. Guards: `is_list(items)`, `worker_count > 0`, `is_function(process_fn,1)`.
- **Approach**: `partition/2` splits items evenly (first `rem(total,n)` chunks get +1), always returns exactly `n` lists (some `[]` when workers > items). Shared coordinator = `Agent` holding `%{worker_id => remaining_queue}`. Each worker = `Task.async` running `process_local_queue` tail-recursion with result accumulator; `Task.await_many(:infinity)` then `List.flatten`, then `Agent.stop`. Coordinator ops all atomic: `pop_item` (`get_and_update`, `[head|tail]` or `:empty`), `find_victim` (rejects self + empty queues, `Enum.max_by` on length → busiest), `steal_half` (`get_and_update`; if `len < 2` returns `[]`, else `Enum.split(queue, len - div(len,2))` steals back half). Thief prepends stolen items and resumes. Failed steal (`[]`) → retry with fresh scan; no victim → done.
- **Key invariants tested**: all items processed exactly once (`uniq_by`); `worker_id` in bounds; all workers used when items ≫ workers; `worker_count > item_count` still completes; single worker never steals (`worker_ids == [0]`); slow-vs-fast items → `max_count > min_count` proving stealing produced uneven distribution; empty items → `[]`.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Steals from back (victim consumes front) so stolen items are furthest from imminent processing. `async: false`.

### 070 — Saga (saga compensating transaction coordinator)
- **Interface**: `Saga.new()` → `%Saga{steps: []}`; `Saga.step(saga, name, action_fn, compensate_fn)` (name atom, `action/1` → `{:ok,res}|{:error,reason}`, `compensate/1` → any; appended via `steps ++ [entry]`); `Saga.execute(saga, context)` (context must be a map) → `{:ok, final_context}` or `{:error, failed_step_name, reason, compensation_results}` where compensation_results is keyword list `[step_name: compensate_return]` in reverse execution order.
- **Approach**: Pure module + struct, no processes. `run_steps/3` threads context; on success merges `Map.put(context, name, result)` and prepends step to `completed` (already reverse order). `safe_action` normalizes non-ok/error returns to `{:error,{:unexpected_return,other}}` and rescues exceptions → `{:error,{:exception,e,stacktrace}}`. On failure `compensate_all/2` runs every completed compensation in reverse, each in try/rescue (`{:exception,e,st}`)/catch (`{:caught,kind,value}`) so a raising compensation never aborts the rest.
- **Key invariants tested**: enriched context threading (step sees prior results, e.g. `ctx.reserve`); compensations run reverse order for only-completed steps; failed step's own compensation NOT run (only prior); comp results reversed `[b: ..., a: ...]`; compensations receive context at point of failure; all compensations run even if one raises; first-step failure → `{:error,:a,_,[]}`; empty saga returns unchanged context.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Tests use process dictionary (`Process.put/get`) for side-effect tracking to stay processless; `async: true`.

### 071 — Factory (factory module for test data generation)
- **Interface**: `Factory.build/1`, `build/2` (overrides keyword list), `insert/1`, `insert/2` (persists via `MyApp.Repo.insert!/1`), `sequence(name, formatter_fn)` (formatter gets monotonic int from 1; per-name independent counter), `start/0` (starts named Agent). Factories declared as private `factory/1` clauses returning structs.
- **Approach**: Named `Agent` `Factory.SequenceAgent` holds `%{name => counter}`; `sequence/2` uses `Agent.get_and_update` for atomic increment (async-safe). Lazy `ensure_agent_started/0` via `Process.whereis`. Association handled by **zero-arity thunks**: `:post` factory sets `user_id: fn -> insert(:user).id end`; `build/2` merges overrides FIRST (`struct(base, overrides)`) THEN `resolve_thunks/1` calls any remaining `is_function(_,0)` field — so passing `user_id:` override suppresses the implicit user insert. `@compile {:no_warn_undefined, MyApp.Repo}`; uses `struct!/2` at runtime to avoid compile-time schema dep. Built-in factories `:user` (name/email via sequences) and `:post` (title/body/user_id); unknown name raises `ArgumentError`.
- **Key invariants tested**: `build` no DB writes; overrides merge; `insert` returns id and adds record; sequences distinct + independent per name; default emails unique; `build(:post)` inserts one user (user_id populated); `insert(:post)` inserts ≥2 rows; `insert(:post, user_id: id)` skips auto-user (count +1 only); sequences safe under 50 concurrent tasks (all unique).
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: test_harness defines stand-in `MyApp.User`/`MyApp.Post` structs, a `FakeRepo` Agent (auto-increment ids), and `MyApp.Repo` delegating `insert!` to FakeRepo. `async: false`.

### 072 — Clock (test helper for time-dependent code)
- **Interface**: behaviour `Clock` with `@callback now() :: DateTime.t()`. `Clock.Real.now/0` → `DateTime.utc_now()`. `Clock.Fake` GenServer: `start_link(opts)` (`:initial` default `~U[2024-01-01 00:00:00Z]`, optional `:name`), `now/1`, `freeze/2` (replace), `advance/2` (keyword duration). Dispatcher `Clock.now/1`: atom + `function_exported?(clock,:now,0)` → `clock.now()`, else `Clock.Fake.now(clock)`; non-atom (pid) → `Clock.Fake.now/1`.
- **Approach**: Fake state = single `%DateTime{}`. `advance` applies each `{unit, amount}` left-to-right via `DateTime.add(dt, amount, canonical)`; `@unit_aliases` map normalizes plural→singular (`seconds`→`:second`, etc.). Negative amounts allowed (time travel backward). Enables DI: app takes `:clock` option, calls `Clock.now(clock)` uniformly.
- **Key invariants tested**: Real.now within before/after bounds; Fake freeze/read stable; advance by seconds/minutes/hours cumulative & mixed; freeze-then-advance; dispatch to Real (module atom), pid, and registered name; two Fake instances fully isolated; DI `Greeter.greet` returns morning/afternoon/evening from frozen clock.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: One isolation test uses wrong `Clock.Fake.now(clock: c1)` keyword form guarded by `rescue -> :ok` (accepts either calling convention). `async: true`.

### 073 — DBCleaner (database cleaner for integration tests)
- **Interface**: `DBCleaner.start(strategy, opts \\ [])` (strategy `:transaction`|`:truncation`; opts `:repo` required atom, `:tables` list of strings) → `{:ok, strategy}`|`{:error, reason}`; `DBCleaner.clean()` → `:ok`|`{:error, reason}` (safe no-op if never started).
- **Approach**: State carried in **process dictionary** key `{DBCleaner, :state}` (no extra process). `:transaction` start calls `repo.begin_transaction()`, clean calls `repo.rollback()` (async: false only). `:truncation` start is no-op, clean issues `TRUNCATE #{table} RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE` per table via `repo.query!(repo, sql, [])`. Table names validated in start against allowlist regex `~r/\A[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\z/` (SQL-injection guard since identifiers can't be parameterized); non-string/non-list raises `ArgumentError`. Unknown strategy → `{:error, msg}`.
- **Key invariants tested**: truncation start no-op; clean truncates all tables containing `TRUNCATE`/`RESTART IDENTITY`/`CASCADE`; empty tables → no queries; transaction start emits `{:begin}`, clean emits `{:rollback}` and no TRUNCATE; strategy state doesn't bleed between runs; behavioral isolation simulated with Agent "tables".
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Solution calls `repo.begin_transaction/0` and `repo.rollback/0` on the repo module directly (prompt mentioned `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.begin_transaction/1` "or equivalent"). test_harness `FakeRepo` Agent records `[{:query,sql}|{:begin}|{:rollback}]`. `async: false`.

### 074 — AssertHelpers (custom ExUnit assertion helpers)
- **Interface**: `use AssertHelpers` (imports macros). Three macros: `assert_changeset_error(changeset, field, message)` (exact string match on a field error); `assert_recent(datetime, tolerance_seconds \\ 5)` (DateTime/NaiveDateTime within tolerance of `DateTime.utc_now()`); `assert_eventually(func, timeout_ms \\ 1_000, interval_ms \\ 50)` (poll zero-arity fn until truthy or timeout).
- **Approach**: All are `defmacro` (so ExUnit reports correct file/line), all fail via `ExUnit.Assertions.flunk/1` with rich diagnostics. `assert_changeset_error` reads `changeset.errors` directly (NOT `Ecto.Changeset.traverse_errors/2`, which would crash on lightweight fakes) via `Keyword.get_values(field)` + maps `{msg,_opts}`; failure shows field errors or "no errors" + all_errors. `assert_recent` normalizes NaiveDateTime → `DateTime.from_naive!(ndt,"Etc/UTC")`, computes `abs(DateTime.diff(now,dt,:second))`, message shows actual/current/diff/tolerance. `assert_eventually` delegates to public `AssertHelpers.__poll__/4` (public so macro-generated code can call cross-module) computing `deadline = System.monotonic_time(:millisecond) + timeout_ms`.
- **Key invariants tested**: changeset pass/fail (multiple errors, no match, no field, empty); recent pass at boundary (-4s within 5), fail past/future, message includes "tolerance"; eventually passes immediately/before-timeout, returns truthy value, fails with "timed out"/"100", message includes last value (`:still_pending`) and elapsed/"ms".
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `__poll__` truthiness quirk — treats bare atoms (except `true`) as NOT-done so status atoms `:ok`/`:still_pending` keep polling while integers/tuples/lists count as done: `value != nil and value != false and (not is_atom(value) or value == true)`. Tests use `apply(DateTime,:utc_now,[])` to defeat the type checker narrowing branches. `async: true`.

### 075 — Generators (property-based test generators)
- **Interface** (all return `%StreamData{}`): `Generators.user()` (map `:id` pos_int, `:name` letters-only 1–50, `:email` `<local>@<domain>.<tld>`, `:age` 18–120, `:role` in `[:admin,:editor,:viewer]`); `Generators.money()` (`%{amount: 0..10_000_000, currency: one of USD/EUR/GBP/JPY/CHF}`); `Generators.date_range()` (`%{start_date, end_date}` Dates in 2000-01-01..2100-12-31, `start <= end`); `Generators.non_empty_list(generator)` (1–20 elements); `Generators.one_of_weighted([{weight, gen}])`.
- **Approach**: `alias StreamData, as: SD` (explicit-qualify, avoids bulk-import clashes). `user`/`money` via `SD.fixed_map`. `user_name` = `SD.bind(integer(1..50))` then fill exactly N codepoints from `member_of(?a..?z ++ ?A..?Z)` → structurally non-empty (no filter). `email`/`alnum_segment` similar with lowercase alnum. `date_range` works in gregorian days: binds `start_day`, then `SD.one_of([constant(start_day), integer(start_day..max_day)])` for `end_day` — explicit same-day branch guarantees `:eq` cases appear (not relying on probabilistic bias). `non_empty_list` = `bind(integer(1..20), &list_of(gen, length: &1))`. `one_of_weighted` = `Enum.flat_map` expanding each pair into `List.duplicate(gen, weight)` copies then `SD.one_of` (weight 0 → `[]` → never selected; propagates shrinking).
- **Key invariants tested**: all constraints hold without consumer filtering; role/currency diversity across 300 samples; date_range produces both `:eq` and `:lt` over 500 samples; list length 1–20 with min==1 and max>1; weighted 99:1 → ≥900/1000 common; weight 0 → never; composable with `StreamData.filter/map/list_of` and nesting `non_empty_list(one_of_weighted(...))`.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Only family requiring an external dep (`stream_data` / `ExUnitProperties`). All constraints enforced generatively (no rejection sampling). `async: true`.

## Groups 076–080 — Classic Data Structures

Five self-contained classic data-structure tasks, each a single-shot `_01` (full solution + `test_harness.exs`), no variations and no fill-in-the-middle subtasks in this cluster. Common thread: all are **pure/persistent functional** implementations (explicit "no GenServer/ETS/process" in every prompt) using only the Elixir/Erlang stdlib, returning new values on every mutation; tests enforce immutability of the input value. No clocks, OTP, or external deps anywhere. Structs use `@enforce_keys`; augmentation/index tricks are used for asymptotic efficiency (max_finish augmentation, O(1) size counters, tuple-backed bit arrays). Task 076 uniquely ships a second, deliberately-broken model-generated solution alongside the reference.

### tasks/076_001_trie_01 — Trie (Prefix Tree)
- **Interface**: `Trie.new/0`, `insert(trie, word)`, `member?(trie, word)::bool`, `search(trie, prefix)::[String.t] (sorted)`, `delete(trie, word)`, `size(trie)::non_neg_integer`, `words(trie)::[String.t] (sorted)`. All `word`/`prefix` guarded `is_binary`.
- **Approach**: `%Trie{root, size}` struct; each node a plain map `%{children: %{grapheme => node}, end_of_word: boolean}`. Keys are `String.graphemes/1` (unicode-safe, not bytes). `size` stored on struct → O(1) `size/1`. `insert` no-ops (returns same trie, no size bump) if `word_exists?`. `search` = `descend` to prefix node then DFS `collect` + `Enum.sort`; `words` = collect from root with `""` acc. `delete` clears `end_of_word` and prunes dead-end leaf nodes on the way up (`not end_of_word and map_size(children)==0`), preserving shared-prefix nodes.
- **Key invariants tested**: exact-membership (prefix "hell" not member of "hello"; empty string not a member); duplicate insert doesn't grow size; delete of prefix word ("car") leaves longer word ("card") and vice versa; delete non-existent / delete-from-empty are no-ops; original trie unchanged after insert/delete; 100-word scale test (`word001..word100`, `search("word0")` returns 99).
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Ships an **alternative model-generated solution** `solution_Qwen3.5-4B-Q6_K_gguf.ex` (Qwen3.5-4B Q6_K gguf) that is clearly **broken** — uses `children: nil` sentinel instead of struct, `insert/build_node` recurse incorrectly, `delete_char` has an illegal `Map.delete(...) |> cond do ...` pipe into `cond`, `words/2` references an undefined `trie` var, would not compile/pass. Reference solution is idiomatic and correct.

### tasks/077_001_interval_tree_for_overlapping_range_queries_01 — Interval Tree
- **Interface**: `IntervalTree.new/0` (returns `nil`), `insert(tree, {start, finish})`, `overlapping(tree, {start, finish})::[interval]`, `enclosing(tree, point::integer)::[interval]`. Interval = `{integer, integer}`, `start <= finish` guaranteed by caller.
- **Approach**: Augmented **AVL tree**; node = map `%{interval, max_finish, height, left, right}`, empty tree = `nil`. BST-keyed on `start` (`s <= ns` goes left). `make_node/3` recomputes `height` and `max_finish` (max finish over subtree) bottom-up; full AVL rebalance (`rotate_left/right`, `balance_factor`, LL/LR/RL/RR cases) on every insert → O(log n). Queries use accumulator-passing DFS with two prune rules: (1) skip subtree when `max_finish < qs`/`point`; (2) skip right subtree when node `start > qf`/`point`. Overlap predicate `s <= qf and f >= qs` (touching endpoints count).
- **Key invariants tested**: empty tree → `[]`; touching intervals overlap (`{1,5}`&`{5,10}` both match query `{5,5}`); degenerate `{4,4}` point intervals; `enclosing` returns all containing intervals; **duplicate intervals stored and both returned**; persistence (t0/t1/t2 independent); 200-interval scale test with 3-hit range query and single-hit point query. Tests use unordered membership (`in`, `length`) since results aren't sorted.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Result lists are unsorted (accumulator order); doctests in `@moduledoc` sort explicitly. Correct AVL augmentation maintenance through rotations is the tricky part.

### tasks/078_001_ring_buffer_01 — Ring Buffer (Circular Buffer)
- **Interface**: `RingBuffer.new(capacity)` (guard `is_integer and > 0`), `push(buffer, item)`, `to_list(buffer)::list (oldest→newest)`, `size(buffer)::0..capacity`, `peek_oldest(buffer)::{:ok, item}|:error`, `peek_newest(buffer)::{:ok, item}|:error`.
- **Approach**: `%RingBuffer{capacity, store, read, write, size}` struct. Prompt **mandates a fixed-size tuple** backing store (`:erlang.make_tuple(capacity, nil)`), 1-based access via `:erlang.element/setelement` (offset +1), integer `read`/`write` head indices wrapping via `rem(_, cap)` — explicitly forbids list/`Enum`-grown store. `push` writes at `write`, advances `write`; when full (`size == cap`) also advances `read` (overwrite oldest, size pinned at cap), else bumps `size`. `to_list` maps `size` offsets from `read` with wraparound. `peek_newest` index = `rem(write - 1 + cap, cap)`.
- **Key invariants tested**: empty → `:error`/`[]`/size 0; size grows to and caps at capacity; oldest overwritten on overflow (`push 1..4` cap 3 → `[2,3,4]`); 20-push-into-cap-4 keeps `[17,18,19,20]`; capacity-1 buffer; mixed value types (ints, strings, atoms, tuples, lists).
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: FIFO overwrite semantics (not error-on-full). `nil` sentinel in unused slots (fine since `size` bounds reads).

### tasks/079_001_bloom_filter_01 — Bloom Filter
- **Interface**: `BloomFilter.new(expected_size, false_positive_rate)` (guards: `expected_size` positive int; rate `is_float`, `0.0 < p < 1.0`), `add(filter, item)::t`, `member?(filter, item)::bool`, `merge(filter1, filter2)::t` (raises `ArgumentError` on differing `m`/`k`).
- **Approach**: `%BloomFilter{m, k, bits}` struct. Optimal params: `m = ceil(-n*ln(p)/ln(2)^2)`, `k = max(1, round(m/n*ln2))` with `@ln2 :math.log(2)` module attr. `bits` = tuple of 64-bit-word integers (`Tuple.duplicate(0, ceil(m/64))`), bit ops via `Bitwise` (`bor/bsl/bsr/band`), word index `div(_,64)`, offset `rem(_,64)`, `put_elem`/`elem` for O(1) word access. `k` independent hashes derived from one primitive: `:erlang.phash2({seed, item}, m)` for `seed <- 0..k-1`. `add` folds set_bit over seeds; `member?` = `Enum.all?` bits set; `merge` zips both tuples word-wise with `bor` (second `merge/2` clause raises).
- **Key invariants tested**: computed `m,k > 0`; tighter p → larger m; larger n → larger m; **no false negatives** (500 items, and atoms/ints/tuples/`{"hello",:world}`); empirical false-positive rate `< 2*p` (n=1000, p=0.03); empty filter no members; merge union membership; merge raises on mismatched params; merge with empty is identity; **merge commutative → identical `bits`**; add idempotent (bits unchanged on re-add).
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `phash2/2` seeding-by-tuple is the prescribed trick for k independent hashes; probabilistic FP test relies on `phash2` determinism.

### tasks/080_001_directed_acyclic_graph_with_topological_sort_01 — DAG with Topological Sort
- **Interface**: `DAG.new/0`, `add_vertex(dag, vertex)::t` (idempotent), `add_edge(dag, from, to)::{:ok, t}|{:error, :cycle}`, `topological_sort(dag)::{:ok, [vertex]}`, `predecessors(dag, vertex)::[vertex]`, `successors(dag, vertex)::[vertex]`. Vertices = any term.
- **Approach**: `%DAG{vertices: MapSet, out_edges: %{v=>MapSet}, in_edges: %{v=>MapSet}}` — forward + reverse adjacency both maintained. `add_edge` uses `with` chain: `require_vertex` (both must exist, else `{:error, :vertex_not_found}`) → `check_no_cycle` → commit via `Map.update!` on both edge maps. **Eager cycle detection** (prompt-mandated): self-loop rejected explicitly; otherwise iterative-DFS `dfs_reaches?(out_edges, to, from)` — cycle iff `from` reachable from `to`. `topological_sort` = **Kahn's algorithm**: build in-degree map from `in_edges` sizes, seed queue with zero-in-degree vertices sorted for determinism, `kahn/4` decrements successor in-degrees, appends newly-zero vertices `Enum.sort`ed → deterministic ordering.
- **Key invariants tested**: empty → `{:ok, []}`; duplicate `add_vertex` ignored; direct/self/indirect cycles rejected; linear chain gives exact `[:a,:b,:c]`; diamond and known dep graph (mix→hex→ssl→crypto/public_key) validated via helper `valid_topological_order?` (from-before-to index check); isolated vertices included; predecessors/successors direct-neighbor correctness and mutual consistency.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Determinism via sorting zero-in-degree frontier (so linear chain yields the exact expected order, not just any valid one); prompt explicitly requires DFS cycle detection + Kahn's for sort (both implemented). Iterative (explicit-stack) DFS to avoid deep-graph stack overflow.

## Groups 086–101 — Business Logic & Security

Eight independent single-file Elixir modules exercising business-rules and application-security patterns: e-commerce pricing, RBAC, input sanitization/XSS/SQLi/path-traversal defense, password policy, HMAC-signed tokens, PII log-masking, RFC-6238 TOTP, and a rate-limiting sliding-window counter. Mostly pure data/functional modules (086, 087, 096, 097, 099, 100); two are OTP-based (098 test uses an Agent clock, 101 is a GenServer). Determinism for time-sensitive code is achieved by injecting a `:clock` zero-arity function (098, 100 via `:time` opt, 101). Every family has ONLY the `_01` single-shot directory — no `b=02+` problem variations and no `d=02+` fill-in-the-middle subtasks exist in this cluster. All standard-library only, no external deps.

### 086_001 — Shopping Cart with Price Calculations
- **Interface**: `Cart.new(opts \\ [])` (`:tax_rate` float, default `0.0`); `Cart.add_item(cart, product_id, quantity, unit_price) :: {:ok, cart} | {:error, :invalid_quantity}`; `Cart.remove_item(cart, product_id) :: cart` (no-op if absent); `Cart.update_quantity(cart, product_id, quantity) :: {:ok, cart} | {:error, :not_found | :invalid_quantity}`; `Cart.calculate_totals(cart) :: %{subtotal, tax, grand_total, items}`.
- **Approach**: Pure structs, no OTP/DB. `%Cart{tax_rate, items: %{product_id => %Cart.Item{}}}`; nested `Cart.Item` struct `[:product_id, :quantity, :unit_price, discount_rate: 0.0]` with `@enforce_keys`. `add_item` uses `Map.update/4` (accumulates qty; **first price wins**, stored unit_price unchanged on re-add). Totals computed by mapping `build_item_summary/1` over `Map.values`.
- **Key invariants tested**: bulk discount = 10% off unit_price when `quantity >= 10` (module attrs `@bulk_discount_threshold 10`, `@bulk_discount_rate 0.10`); discount is **per-line-item, not per-cart**; `line_total = unit_price * (1 - discount_rate) * quantity`; tax applied on **discounted** subtotal (`subtotal * tax_rate`); `update_quantity` to 0 removes item; zero/negative qty rejected; empty cart → all zeros. Uses `assert_in_delta` for float math.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: All monetary values floats; qty=9 vs qty=10 boundary explicitly tested. ExUnit `async: true`.

### 087_001 — Permission System with Role-Based Access
- **Interface**: `Permissions.can?(role, resource, action, rules) :: boolean` (delegates to arity-5 with `[]`); `Permissions.can?(role, resource, action, rules, opts) :: boolean`.
- **Approach**: Role ranks via `@role_rank %{viewer: 0, editor: 1, manager: 2, admin: 3}`. `rules :: %{resource => %{action => required_role | :owner}}`. Uses `with` chain `fetch_resource → fetch_action → check`; unknown resource/action returns `:error` → `false` (never raises). `check/3` has three clauses: `:owner` (identity check), normal role (guarded `rank(role) >= rank(required_role)`), catch-all deny.
- **Key invariants tested**: higher role inherits all lower-role permissions (monotonic hierarchy — property test iterates adjacent role pairs); `:owner` rule is identity-based, role-**irrelevant** — grants iff `owner_id == user_id` (both non-nil), so even `:admin` denied on id mismatch, `:viewer` granted on match; missing owner opts → deny; unknown resource/action → false.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `:owner` composable alongside role-gated actions on same resource. ExUnit `async: true`.

### 096_001 — Input Sanitizer Module
- **Interface**: `Sanitizer.html(input, opts \\ [])` (`:allow` allowlist, default `~w[b i em strong a]`); `Sanitizer.sql_identifier(input) :: {:ok, String.t()} | {:error, :empty}`; `Sanitizer.filename(input) :: {:ok, String.t()} | {:error, :empty}`.
- **Approach**: HTML in two phases: (1) `strip_raw_content_tags/1` regex (caseless+dotall) nukes `script|style|noscript|iframe` **with inner content**; (2) hand-rolled single-pass char-by-char state machine (`:text`/`:tag` states, iodata accumulator) — no external HTML parser. Allowlisted tags rebuilt attribute-free except `href` on `<a>`; disallowed tags stripped but inner text kept. `poisoned_a` boolean state suppresses both the opening and matching `</a>` when href is a `javascript:` URI (checked by stripping `\x00-\x20` then case-insensitive `starts_with?("javascript:")`). `href` extraction handles double/single/unquoted via 3 regexes; values HTML-escaped. `sql_identifier` strips `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]`, prepends `_` if leading digit, `{:error, :empty}` if blank. `filename` strips null bytes, `/`, `\`, non-`[a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]`, collapses `\.{2,}` → `.`, trims leading/trailing dots.
- **Key invariants tested**: tag case normalized to lowercase (`<B>`→`<b>`); XSS vectors (`onerror`, `onclick`) stripped; `javascript:` (any case + leading whitespace) neutralized keeping inner text; custom `:allow` respected; SQLi payload `col' OR '1'='1` → `colOR11`; traversal `../../etc/passwd` → `etcpasswd`, Windows `..\Windows\System32` sanitized.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Slashes stripped (not converted), so path segments concatenate directly. ExUnit `async: true`.

### 097_001 — Password Policy Enforcer
- **Interface**: single public `PasswordPolicy.validate(password, context) :: :ok | {:error, [atom()]}`; also public `levenshtein(a, b)` (marked `@doc false`). Raises `ArgumentError` if `context` lacks `:username`.
- **Approach**: `build_config/1` merges context over 10 module-attr defaults (`min_length 8`, `max_length 128`, `require_*` all `true`, `common_passwords []`, `previous_passwords []`, `max_username_similarity 3`). Runs a **list of 9 check closures** (`&check_min_length/2` … `&check_username_similarity/2`) via `Enum.reduce`, collecting **all** violations (reversed to preserve rule-evaluation order). Self-implemented Levenshtein: iterative two-row DP over `String.graphemes` (Unicode-safe), O(m·n) time / O(min) space, swaps to keep shorter string as columns.
- **Key invariants tested**: all violations reported not just first; violation atoms `:too_short, :too_long, :no_uppercase, :no_lowercase, :no_digit, :no_special, :common_password, :reused_password, :too_similar_to_username`; special = `[^a-zA-Z0-9]`; common-password match case-insensitive; reuse match exact; similarity rejects when `distance <= threshold` (identical password → distance 0 → rejected); toggling `require_*: false` skips that check.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: test_harness.exs is NOT ExUnit — a **hand-rolled `PasswordPolicyTest.run/0`** framework printing `✓/✗` and calling `System.halt(1)` on failure (uses `MapSet.subset?`/`equal?` for order-independent multi-violation asserts).

### 098_001 — Token Generator and Validator
- **Interface**: `SecureToken.generate(payload, secret, ttl_seconds, opts \\ []) :: token` (guards `is_binary(secret)`, `ttl_seconds > 0`); `SecureToken.verify(token, secret, opts \\ []) :: {:ok, term} | {:error, :expired | :invalid_signature | :malformed}`. `opts` only key is `:clock` (zero-arity → Unix seconds; default `System.os_time(:second)`).
- **Approach**: Stateless HMAC-SHA256 tokens. Wire format `<<issued_at::signed-64, expires_at::signed-64, payload_size::unsigned-32, payload::binary, mac::binary-32>>` where payload = `:erlang.term_to_binary/1`, then `Base.url_encode64(_, padding: false)`. MAC via `:crypto.mac(:hmac, :sha256, secret, data)` over the length-prefixed data region. `verify` is a strict `with` pipeline: `decode_base64 → split_mac (trailing 32B) → parse_data (structural, guard `byte_size(rest) == payload_size`) → verify_mac → check_expiry → decode_payload`. Constant-time MAC compare via `bor`/`bxor` fold (`import Bitwise`). Deserialize with `:erlang.binary_to_term(bytes, [:safe])` rescuing `ArgumentError`.
- **Key invariants tested**: exact error precedence — any pre-HMAC failure = `:malformed`, HMAC mismatch = `:invalid_signature` (**takes precedence over expiry** even for expired tokens with wrong secret), post-HMAC expiry = `:expired`, post-HMAC deserialize failure = `:malformed`; **strict `<`** expiry so `now == expires_at` is already expired (at exact ttl boundary); URL-safe output (no `+`/`/`/`=`); cross-secret non-verifiability; arbitrary payload types (atom/int/list/nested map) round-trip.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: Clock injected for deterministic expiry. Test uses `use ExUnit.Case, async: false` + `defmodule Clock` (Agent) started via `start_supervised!({Clock, 1_000_000})`, wrapping generate/verify with `clock: &Clock.now/0`.

### 099_001 — Data Masking for Logs
- **Interface**: `LogMasker.new(sensitive_keys) :: t()` (opaque `%LogMasker{sensitive_keys: MapSet}`); `LogMasker.mask(masker, data) :: term` (map/keyword-list/string/nested); `LogMasker.mask_string(masker, string) :: String.t()`.
- **Approach**: `new/1` normalizes keys (`normalize_key` downcases atom/string → String) into a MapSet. `do_mask` recursion: plain maps (`is_map and not is_struct`) via `Map.new`, lists distinguish keyword-list (`keyword_list?` all `{atom,_}`) from plain lists, strings routed through `mask_string`, everything else (structs/numbers/atoms/tuples) untouched. Sensitive key → value replaced with `"[MASKED]"` regardless of type. `mask_string` applies 3 regexes in order: credit-card (`\b\d(?:[\s-]?\d){12,18}\b`, 13–19 digits) masking all but last 4 with `*` keeping separators (`mask_cc_match` walks graphemes counting digits); SSN (`\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b` → `***-**-****`); email (`([local])@([domain])` → first char + `***@domain`).
- **Key invariants tested**: case-insensitive key matching for atom AND string keys; recursive nested maps / lists-of-maps / keyword lists; non-sensitive keys preserved but their **string values still pattern-masked** (embedded SSN/email/CC scrubbed everywhere); non-string sensitive values (int/nil/list) → `[MASKED]`; empty masker masks structurally nothing but still pattern-masks strings; CC last-4 preserved with dash/space/no separators.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `@opaque t`; `mask_string` order is CC→SSN→email (SSN before email to avoid interference). ExUnit `async: true`.

### 100_001 — TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password)
- **Interface**: `TOTP.generate_secret() :: String.t()` (base32, 160-bit/20-byte, unpadded); `TOTP.generate_code(secret, time \\ :os.system_time(:second)) :: String.t()` (6-digit zero-padded); `TOTP.valid?(secret, code, opts \\ []) :: boolean` (`:time` default now, `:window` default 1 step each direction); `TOTP.provisioning_uri(secret, issuer, account_name) :: String.t()`.
- **Approach**: RFC 6238, `@period 30`, `@digits 6`, `@secret_bytes 20`. `generate_secret` = `:crypto.strong_rand_bytes(20)` → self-implemented base32. `generate_code`: `step = div(time, 30)`, `<<step::big-unsigned-integer-size(64)>>`, `:crypto.mac(:hmac, :sha, key, counter)`, RFC-4226 dynamic truncation (`offset = last_byte &&& 0x0F`, read 4 bytes, `&&& 0x7F` top bit), `rem 1_000_000`, `String.pad_leading(6, "0")`. `valid?` iterates `-window..window` steps with constant-time `secure_equal?` compare; `normalize_code` accepts int or string. Self-implemented RFC-4648 base32 encode (5-byte→8-char groups, bit-padded tail) / decode (5-bit chunks). `provisioning_uri` builds `otpauth://totp/<issuer:account>?...` with `URI.encode`/`URI.encode_query`, params `secret, issuer, algorithm=SHA1, digits=6, period=30`.
- **Key invariants tested**: **canonical RFC 6238 test vectors** (secret `GEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQGEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQ`): t=59→`287082`, t=1111111109→`081804`, t=1111111111→`050471`, t=1234567890→`005924` (leading-zero case), t=2000000000→`279037`, t=20000000000→`353130`; secret matches `[A-Z2-7]+`, unique per call; code stable across the 30s step, changes at boundary; window drift ±1 step accepted, ±2 rejected unless `window: 2`, `window: 0` exact-only; URI parseable with `URI.parse`, special chars encoded.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `time` param is the injectable clock (no separate opt); `import Bitwise`. ExUnit `async: true`; vectors generated at compile time via a `for` comprehension emitting tests.

### 101_001 — Sliding Window Counter
- **Interface**: `SlidingCounter.start_link(opts) :: GenServer.on_start` (`:clock` zero-arity ms, default `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)`; `:bucket_ms` default `1_000`; `:max_window_ms` default `bucket_ms * 60`; `:cleanup_interval_ms` default `60_000`, `:infinity` disables; `:name`); `SlidingCounter.increment(server, key) :: :ok`; `SlidingCounter.count(server, key, window_ms) :: non_neg_integer`.
- **Approach**: GenServer, state `%{clock, bucket_ms, max_window_ms, cleanup_interval_ms, keys: %{key => %{bucket_index => count}}}`. `start_link` uses `Keyword.split(opts, [:name])` to separate GenServer opts. `bucket_for = Integer.floor_div(timestamp_ms, bucket_ms)`. **increment is a `call`** (not cast) so timestamp is read before returning — deterministic under manual clock advance. `count`: computes `min_bucket = -Integer.floor_div(-(now - window_ms), bucket_ms)` (ceiling div) and sums counts of buckets `b >= min_bucket` — **bucket-start-in-window** semantics (stricter than mere overlap). Cleanup via `Process.send_after(self(), :cleanup, interval)`, rescheduled after each run; `handle_info(:cleanup, ...)` also directly triggerable for synchronous tests; `do_cleanup` drops buckets/keys with start before `now - max_window_ms` (`Map.filter`, empty inner map → whole key removed). Catch-all `handle_info(_msg, state)` ignores stray messages.
- **Key invariants tested**: zero for unseen key; events outside `[now-window_ms, now]` excluded (`advance(1001)`→0, `advance(999)`→still counted); per-key independence and independent expiry; after cleanup `map_size(state.keys) == 0` when all expired (probed via `:sys.get_state`), active keys survive; `window_ms < bucket_ms` works; very large window (86_400_000) includes all; ceiling-div boundary semantics ("event at T in window iff T >= now - window_ms").
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `@default_max_window_buckets 60` (60× bucket_ms) chosen so tests can actually evict without hours of clock advance. ExUnit `async: false` with Agent-based `Clock` (`start_supervised!({Clock, 0})`, `clock: &Clock.now/0`, `bucket_ms: 100`, `cleanup_interval_ms: :infinity`).

## Groups 623–626 — Mini Real-World Systems

Four self-contained "mini clone" tasks, each a single GenServer that reimplements the core data model of a well-known infrastructure system in pure OTP (no external deps, single file). Every family is a single `_01` full single-shot task with `prompt.md` + `solution.ex` + `test_harness.exs` — there are **no `b=02+` variations and no `d=02+` fill-in-the-middle subtasks** in this cluster (glob `tasks/623_* … 626_*` returns exactly four dirs). Common thread: content/data-addressable storage, deterministic serialization or scoring, and ExUnit harnesses that assert exact structural results; two families (S3, TSDB) exercise real side effects (filesystem persistence, injected clock + `Process.send_after` cleanup).

### 623_001 — Mini Elasticsearch-like Inverted Index (`InvertedIndex`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (opts `:name`, `:stop_words` MapSet); `index(server, id, fields, opts \\ [])` (fields = `%{field => text}`, opts `:stem`) → `:ok`; `remove(server, id)` → `:ok` (no-op if absent); `search(server, query, opts \\ [])` (opts `:boosts` map `%{field => n}`, `:limit`, `:stem`) → `[%{id:, score:}]` desc; `suggest(server, prefix, limit \\ 10)` → `[String.t()]`; `stats(server)` → `%{document_count:, term_count:}`.
- **Approach**: GenServer, plain-map state: `docs: %{id => %{field => [token]}}`, `postings: %{term => %{id => %{field => count}}}`, `doc_freq: %{term => count}`. Tokenize = `String.downcase |> String.split(~r/[^a-z0-9]+/, trim: true) |> reject stop_words |> optional stem`. TF-IDF: `tf = count/total_tokens_in_field`, `idf = :math.log(total_docs/df)`; per term summed over fields as `tf*idf*boost` (default boost 1), summed across query terms. Re-index calls `do_remove` first to keep counts consistent. `suggest` filters `doc_freq` keys by prefix, sorts by df desc.
- **Key invariants tested**: higher TF ranks first; rarer term → higher IDF can outscore common term; stop words unsearchable; custom stop_words replace defaults ("the" then indexable); `title` boost reorders; term in 2 fields > 1 field; `limit` caps; removal decrements doc count + purges postings; re-index replaces cleanly (old terms gone, count stays 1); suggest sorted by df, respects limit, case-insensitive, empty on miss; punctuation stripped; `:name` registration.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `stem/1` and `tokenize/3` are public (`@doc false`) — caller must keep index/search stem flags consistent (stemmed index + unstemmed query → no match, asserted). Stemmer strips (in order) `tion→t, ment, ing, er, ly, ed, s` with a "root ≥ 2 chars" guard, plus an **undocumented** `dedup_trailing_consonant/1` (drops doubled final consonant). Scores are raw floats, not normalized. Default 33-word stop list hardcoded as `@default_stop_words`.

### 624_001 — Mini Git-like Object Store (`ObjectStore`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:name`); `store(server, content)` → `{:ok, hash}` (idempotent); `retrieve(server, hash)` → `{:ok, content} | {:error, :not_found}`; `tree(server, entries)` (entries = `%{name:, hash:, type: :blob|:tree}`) → `{:ok, tree_hash}`; `commit(server, tree_hash, parent_hash | nil, message, author)` → `{:ok, commit_hash}`; `log(server, commit_hash)` → `{:ok, [%{hash:, message:, author:, tree:, parent:}]}` newest→oldest | `{:error, :not_found}`.
- **Approach**: GenServer state is a single flat map `%{sha1_hex => raw_binary}` — no type tag at storage layer. Hash = `:crypto.hash(:sha, content) |> Base.encode16(case: :lower)` (40-char). `do_store` uses `Map.put_new` (dedup). Tree serialization: `Enum.sort_by(&.name)` then `map_join("\n", "type hash name")` — order-independent hash. Commit serialization fixed order: `"tree H\nparent P\nauthor A\nmessage M"` where nil parent → literal `"nil"`. `log` recursively walks parent via `parse_commit` (`String.split("\n", parts: 4)` so message may contain newlines) + `strip_prefix`.
- **Key invariants tested**: hash matches `:crypto` SHA-1; dedup returns same hash; tree hash independent of entry order but sensitive to content; empty tree/empty content OK; binary/null-byte content roundtrips; commit deterministic for same metadata; multi-line/special-char messages preserved; log walks 3-commit chain newest→oldest with correct parents; unknown start hash → `:not_found`; full blobs→trees→commits→log workflow with every object retrievable.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `walk_log` distinguishes a missing **start** commit (`{:error, :not_found}`) from a **dangling parent** mid-chain (stops gracefully, returns partial log). Serialization is human-readable text, not Git's real `type size\0` header + zlib — a deliberate simplification. `store/2` and `retrieve/2` have `is_binary` guards.

### 625_001 — Mini S3-like Object Storage (`ObjectStorage`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:root_dir` default `"./object_storage_data"`, `:name`); `create_bucket/2` → `:ok | {:error, :already_exists | :invalid_name}`; `delete_bucket/2` → `:ok | {:error, :not_found | :not_empty}`; `list_buckets/1` → `{:ok, sorted names}`; `put_object(server, bucket, key, data, content_type \\ "application/octet-stream", metadata \\ %{})` → `:ok | {:error, :bucket_not_found}`; `get_object/3` → `{:ok, %{data:, content_type:, metadata:, size:, last_modified: DateTime}} | {:error, :bucket_not_found | :not_found}`; `delete_object/3` (idempotent) → `:ok | {:error, :bucket_not_found}`; `list_objects(server, bucket, opts)` (`:prefix` "", `:max_keys` 1000) → `{:ok, [%{key:, size:, last_modified:}]}` sorted; `copy_object/5` → `:ok | {:error, :src_bucket_not_found | :dst_bucket_not_found | :not_found}`; multipart: `start_multipart/5` → `{:ok, upload_id}`, `upload_part(server, upload_id, part_number, data)`, `complete_multipart/2` (`:no_parts` if empty), `abort_multipart/2`.
- **Approach**: GenServer, **filesystem-backed** at `root_dir/buckets/<name>/objects/`. Object key url-safe-encoded via `:erlang.term_to_binary(key) |> Base.url_encode64(padding: false)`; each object = `<enc>.data` (raw) + `<enc>.meta` (`:erlang.term_to_binary(%{content_type, metadata, size, last_modified})`). No in-memory bucket/object index — every call hits `File.dir?`/`File.ls!`/`File.read!`. Bucket name validated by `~r/\A[a-z0-9.\-]+\z/` (non-empty). `list_objects` reads `.meta` filenames, decodes keys, filters by prefix, sorts, `take(max_keys)`. Multipart state is **in-memory only** (`state.multipart_uploads: %{upload_id => %{bucket, key, content_type, metadata, parts: %{part_num => data}}}`); `complete` sorts parts by number, `IO.iodata_to_binary`, writes object, deletes upload_id. `upload_id = :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(16) |> Base.url_encode64`.
- **Key invariants tested**: bucket CRUD + validation (rejects "", UPPER, spaces, underscore; allows hyphens/dots/digits); delete non-empty → `:not_empty`; put overwrites silently; default content_type; 4 KB random binary roundtrip; prefix + max_keys listing; copy within/across buckets, same-key no-op, all 3 copy error paths; multipart out-of-order + same-part overwrite + `:no_parts` + invalidation after complete/abort; **objects survive `GenServer.stop` + restart with same root_dir** (metadata too); concurrent multipart uploads isolated.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: harness uses `@moduletag :tmp_dir` (ExUnit auto per-test temp dir). Persistence is the differentiator — durability comes for free from the filesystem layout; multipart deliberately does NOT survive restart. `delete_object` on a missing bucket errors, but on a missing key succeeds (idempotent `File.rm` ignores result).

### 626_001 — Mini Prometheus-like Time-Series DB (`TSDB`)
- **Interface**: `start_link(opts)` (`:chunk_duration_ms` 60_000, `:retention_ms` 3_600_000, `:cleanup_interval_ms` 60_000 or `:infinity`, `:clock` zero-arity ms fn default `fn -> System.monotonic_time(:millisecond) end`, `:name`); `insert(server, metric_name, labels, timestamp, value)` → `:ok` (**GenServer.cast**); `query(server, metric_name, label_matchers, {start_ts, end_ts})` → `[{labels_map, [{ts, value}]}]`; `query_agg(server, metric, matchers, {start_ts, end_ts}, aggregation, step_ms)` (`aggregation ∈ :avg | :sum | :max | :rate`) → `[{labels, [{window_start, agg_value}]}]`.
- **Approach**: pure GenServer (no ETS, no child processes). State `series: %{{metric_name, sorted_labels} => %{chunk_start => [sorted {ts, value}]}}`. `sorted_labels = Enum.sort(Map.to_list(labels))` so label order can't fork a series. `chunk_start = div(timestamp, chunk_duration_ms) * chunk_duration_ms`. `insert_sorted/2` keeps each chunk ascending by ts (dup ts appended after). `do_query` narrows to chunks in `[chunk_start_for(start), chunk_start_for(end)]`, flattens, filters `start_ts <= ts <= end_ts` **inclusive**, sorts. `labels_match?` = all matcher pairs present (empty map matches all; superset labels allowed). Aggregation windows are **half-open** `[start, end)` stepped by `step_ms` (`Stream.iterate |> take_while(< end_ts)`); empty windows (and `<2` points for `:rate`) omitted. `:rate = (last_v - first_v) / ((last_ts - first_ts)/1000)`.
- **Key invariants tested**: out-of-order inserts sorted; inclusive time filter; label subset matching + empty-matcher-matches-all + label-order dedup; multi-chunk span + sub-range chunk pruning; `:sum/:avg/:max/:rate` exact values; rate omits <2-pt windows; empty windows omitted; per-series separate aggregations; boundary point `t=1000` lands in chunk 1000 not 0; **cleanup** removes chunks where `chunk_start + chunk_duration_ms <= now - retention_ms` and drops emptied series.
- **Variations**: none. **Subtasks**: none.
- **Notable**: `insert` is async `cast` — determinism relies on later sync `call`s (query) draining the mailbox. **Injected clock**: harness uses an Agent-based `Clock` (`now/advance/set`, registered by module name); cleanup is triggered manually via `send(db, :cleanup)` then `:sys.get_state(db)` to force synchronous processing (tests set `cleanup_interval_ms: :infinity`, `chunk_duration_ms: 1_000`, `retention_ms: 10_000`). `schedule_cleanup` uses `Process.send_after(self(), :cleanup, interval)`, no-op on `:infinity`. Subtle boundary asymmetry to note: `query` bounds inclusive, `query_agg` windows half-open.

## tasks_multifile/ — Phoenix/Ecto Multi-File Tasks

Eleven multi-file backend tasks. Unlike other clusters these dirs are **flat** — no `_b` variations, no `_d` fill-in-the-middle subtasks; each dir is one whole-app task with `prompt.md` + `test_harness.exs` (an ExUnit file), and the reference `solution.ex` bundles every module inline via `<file path="...">…</file>` blocks. Common thread: build a small but complete Elixir web/back-end feature (Phoenix+Ecto JSON API, or bare `Plug`+`Jason`, or pure OTP GenServer) exercising real-world API concerns — pagination, filtering, soft-delete, bulk/partial writes, uploads, versioning, authz, idempotency, HMAC webhooks, long-polling, persisted state machines. **Solved (have solution.ex): 016, 017, 018, 102. Unsolved (prompt + test_harness only): 019–025** — for those the interface/behavior below is reconstructed from the prompt and the enforced tests. Every task forbids external libs beyond Phoenix/Ecto or Plug/Jason (+`:crypto`); several inject a clock or fake repo for determinism.

### 016 paginated_list_endpoint — Offset Pagination (SOLVED)
- **Interface**: `PaginatedList.Items.list_items(params \\ %{})` → `%{data: [Item], meta: %{current_page, page_size, total_count, total_pages}}`; controller `PaginatedListWeb.ItemController.index/2` renders via `Phoenix.Controller.json/2`; route `get "/items"` under `/api`. Schema `PaginatedList.Item` (`items` table, `:name` string + `timestamps(type: :utc_datetime_usec)`).
- **Approach**: string params `"page"`/`"page_size"` parsed with `Integer.parse` (guards `n >= 1`); defaults page=1, size=20, `@max_page_size 100` via `min/2`; `offset = (page-1)*page_size`; base query `order_by: [asc: i.inserted_at, asc: i.id]` for determinism; `Repo.aggregate(:count, :id)` for total; `compute_total_pages(0,_) → 0` else `ceil(total/size)`. Serializes `inserted_at` with `DateTime.to_iso8601/1`. Migration adds composite index `[:inserted_at, :id]`.
- **Key invariants tested**: default page 20; clamp size>100→100; page/size ≤0 or non-numeric → defaults; page beyond total → empty `data` but correct meta; empty DB → total_pages 0; exact vs non-exact division rounding; page-2 disjoint from page-1.
- **Notable**: test seeds via `Repo.insert_all(returning: true)` with monotonically increasing `inserted_at`.

### 017 search_endpoint_with_filtering_and_sorting — Search/Filter/Sort (SOLVED)
- **Interface**: `MyApp.Products.list_products(params)` → `{:ok, [Product]} | {:error, :invalid_sort_field}`; `MyAppWeb.ProductController.index/2` → `MyAppWeb.ProductJSON.index/1` (`%{data: [...]}`); route `get "/products"`. Schema `MyApp.Products.Product` fields `name`/`category`/`price` (`:decimal`, migration col `:numeric`).
- **Approach**: single composable Ecto query piped through `filter_by_name` (ILIKE `"%name%"`), `filter_by_category` (exact `==`), `filter_by_min_price`/`filter_by_max_price` (`Decimal.parse`, `>=`/`<=`), `apply_sorting`. **Security**: `@allowed_sort_fields ~w(name price category)` allowlist; invalid `sort` → `{:error, :invalid_sort_field}` → HTTP 400 `{"error":"invalid sort field"}`; validated field converted via `String.to_existing_atom` and used with `order_by([p],[{^direction, field(p, ^atom)}])`. `order` defaults `:asc`, ignored if no `sort`. Price serialized as string via `Decimal.to_string`.
- **Key invariants tested**: case-insensitive partial name; exact category; inclusive price bounds (incl. min==max); combined filters; SQL-injection sort strings return 400 and leave table intact; `order` w/o `sort` → 200 all rows; price is string.
- **Notable**: all filtering/sorting at DB level, single round-trip; uses `~p"/api/products"` verified routes in tests.

### 018 crud_with_soft_delete — CRUD + Soft Delete (SOLVED)
- **Interface** (`SoftCrud.Documents` context): `list_documents(opts \\ [])`, `get_document(id, opts \\ [])`→`{:ok,doc}|{:error,:not_found}`, `create_document/1`, `update_document/2`, `soft_delete_document/1`, `restore_document/1`; all respect `include_deleted: true`. Routes: `resources "/documents", only: [:index,:create,:show,:update,:delete]` + `post "/documents/:id/restore"`. Schema `Document` (`title`,`content`,`deleted_at :utc_datetime`) with two changesets: `changeset/2` (casts only title/content, `validate_required` + `validate_length(:title, min: 1)`) and `soft_delete_changeset/2` (casts only `:deleted_at`).
- **Approach**: `maybe_exclude_deleted(query, false)` adds `where is_nil(d.deleted_at)`. Soft-delete/restore implemented as **guard-clause no-ops**: `soft_delete_document(%{deleted_at: dt}) when not is_nil(dt)` returns `{:ok, doc}` unchanged; `restore_document(%{deleted_at: nil})` same. `deleted_at` set to `DateTime.utc_now() |> DateTime.truncate(:second)`. Update deliberately can't touch `deleted_at` (not in cast list). Full Phoenix app scaffold present (mix.exs, config/*, endpoint, `FallbackController`, `ErrorJSON` with `traverse_errors`).
- **Key invariants tested**: 422 on missing/blank title or missing content; default listings hide soft-deleted; `?include_deleted=true` shows them; write endpoints (PUT/DELETE) 404 on already-deleted; DELETE returns 200+doc, double-delete→404; restore no-op→200; `deleted_at` valid ISO8601; full lifecycle create→update→delete→restore; update can't set `deleted_at`.
- **Notable**: only task shipping a full mix project skeleton; uses Bandit adapter, `action_fallback`.

### 019 bulk_create_endpoint_with_partial_failure_reporting — Bulk Create w/ Partial Failures (UNSOLVED)
- **Interface**: `MyApp.Catalog.bulk_create_items(list_of_attrs, opts \\ [])` — default all-or-nothing → `{:ok|:error, results}` where results are `{index, :ok, item} | {index, :error, changeset}`; `partial: true` inserts valid rows individually. Controller `MyAppWeb.BulkItemController.create/2`, route `post "/api/items/bulk"`. Schema `MyApp.Catalog.Item`: `name` (1–255), `price` (int > 0), `description` (optional, ≤1000).
- **Approach (required)**: default mode wraps in one `Repo.transaction`, any changeset invalid → roll back (zero rows). Partial mode persists valids, skips invalids. Every result entry carries **zero-based original index**. Controller reads `?partial=true` (literal `"true"` only), rejects missing/non-list `"items"` with 400 `{"error":"expected a list of items"}`. Responses: all-created→201 `{status:"all_created", items:[{index,id,name,price,description}]}`; all-failed→422 `{status:"all_failed", errors:[{index,errors}|{index,valid:true}]}`; partial→201 `{status:"partial", created:[…], errors:[…]}`.
- **Key invariants tested**: index correctness for multiple/interleaved failures (incl. only-last-item-fails full rollback via `Repo.aggregate(Item,:count)==0`); partial indices e.g. created `[0,2,4]` / errors `[1,3]`; empty list→201 empty; 50-item batch; created rows fetchable & IDs match DB; description exactly 1000 ok / 1001 fails.
- **Notable**: distinguishes strict transactional rollback vs per-item partial persistence; assumes existing `MyApp.Repo`.

### 020 file_upload_with_validation — Plug File Upload (UNSOLVED, no Phoenix)
- **Interface**: `FileUpload.Router` (`Plug.Router`) `POST /api/uploads`, init opts `:store`/`:upload_dir`/`:base_url`. `FileUpload.Validator.validate(%Plug.Upload{})` → `:ok | {:error, reason}`. `FileUpload.Store` GenServer: `start_link(name:)`, `save/2` (generates UUIDv4 id + ISO8601 `uploaded_at`, returns `{:ok, meta}`), `get/2`→`{:ok,meta}|{:error,:not_found}`, `list/1`.
- **Approach (required)**: `Plug.Parsers` multipart with `:length` 5_242_880; over-limit→413 `{"error":"File too large","max_bytes":5242880}`. Field `"file"`; missing→422 `{"error":"No file provided"}`. Validator: allow only `.csv`/`.json` (case-insensitive on `filename`); CSV must have header-ish content (≥2 lines or comma-separated line) else `Invalid CSV: …`; JSON via `Jason.decode` else `Invalid JSON: <desc>`. Success 201 with `{id, original_name, size, content_type, uploaded_at, download_url}`; file saved to disk as `<uuid><ext>` to avoid collisions.
- **Key invariants tested**: id length 36; size==byte_size; file persisted at `upload_dir/<id>.csv` with exact bytes; rejects `.txt/.exe/no-ext`; case-insensitive `.CSV/.JSON`; 413 just over 5MB, 201 just under; empty/single-value CSV→422; malformed/empty JSON→422 but JSON arrays & primitives accepted; store `get`/`list`; download_url starts with base_url and contains id; same filename twice→distinct ids.
- **Notable**: uses `Plug.Test`; UUID must be self-generated (no external uuid lib).

### 021 versioned_api_with_content_negotiation — Header-Based API Versioning (UNSOLVED, Plug)
- **Interface**: `VersionedApi.Router` (`Plug.Router`) `GET /api/users/:id`; `VersionedApi.Plugs.ApiVersion` plug (opts `:supported` list, `:default`); `VersionedApi.Views.UserView.render(version, user)`. In-memory user map (module attribute), ids `"1"` Alice/Smith, `"2"` Bob/Jones.
- **Approach (required)**: plug reads `accept-version` header → resolves to `conn.assigns[:api_version]`; absent→default `"v2"`; unsupported→halt 406 `{"error":"unsupported version","supported":["v1","v2"]}`. `v1` shape `%{name: "First Last", email}`; `v2` shape `%{first_name, last_name, email, created_at}`. Unknown id→404 `{"error":"not found"}`. All responses `content-type: application/json` via Jason.
- **Key invariants tested**: exclusive key sets per version (v1 lacks first/last/created_at; v2 lacks name); default == explicit v2; 406 for `v3`/`v99`/`banana` incl. before user lookup (plug halts pre-match); 404 for missing user across all versions; content-type on 200/404/406; unmatched route→404.
- **Notable**: test helper has an intentional flipped-`reduce` red herring then a corrected version; `@opts = Router.init([])` at module load.

### 022 nested_resource_endpoint_with_authorization — Nested Resource + Bearer Authz (UNSOLVED, Plug)
- **Interface**: `TeamStore` GenServer: `start_link(name:)`, `create_user/3(id,token)`, `create_team/2`, `add_member/3` (seed), `get_user_by_token/2`→`{:ok,uid}|:error`, `team_exists?/2`, `is_member?/3`, `list_members/2`→`{:ok,[uid]}|{:error,:not_found}`, `add_member_safe/3`→`{:ok,uid}|{:error,:not_found}|{:error,:conflict}`. `AuthPlug` (opt `:store`) reads `Bearer <token>`, assigns `:current_user`, else halt 401 `{"error":"unauthorized"}`. `TeamRouter` (`Plug.Router`, opt `:store`) `GET`/`POST /api/teams/:team_id/members`.
- **Approach (required)**: plug AuthPlug before match. GET: team missing→404 `not_found`; non-member→403 `forbidden`; else 200 `{"members":[…]}`. POST body `{"user_id":…}`: same 404/403; already member→409 `conflict`; success 201 `{"added":user_id}`. All JSON.
- **Key invariants tested**: **ordering precedence** 401(auth) → 404(team) → 403(membership) → 409(conflict); team isolation (team-1 ops don't touch team-2); malformed/missing `user_id`→400 or 422; content-type json; direct `TeamStore` API return values.
- **Notable**: tests also stash store via `put_private(:team_store, store)` and pass `store:` to `init/1`; unique per-test store name.

### 023 idempotent_post_endpoint — Idempotent Payments GenServer (UNSOLVED, pure OTP)
- **Interface**: `IdempotentPayments.start_link(opts)` opts `:clock` (0-arity ms fn, default `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)`), `:ttl_ms` (default 86_400_000), `:cleanup_interval_ms` (default 60_000, `:infinity` disables). `process_payment(server, params, idempotency_key \\ nil)`; `get_payments/1`; `get_payment/2`→`{:ok,p}|{:error,:not_found}`. `params` map keys `:amount`,`:currency`,`:recipient`.
- **Approach (required)**: nil key→always new record. Seen unexpired key→return **identical cached response**, no new record. Expired/unseen key→process, cache `{response, expiry}` with TTL. Missing fields→`{:error,:invalid_params}`, and cache the error under the key too. Response `%{id, amount, currency, recipient, status:"completed", created_at: clock()}`; ids sequential `"pay_1"…`. Periodic `:cleanup` via `Process.send_after` + `handle_info` purges only expired idempotency entries; payment records never purged. State exposes `state.idempotency_keys` as `%{key => {resp, expiry}}`.
- **Key invariants tested**: replay identical even when params differ; TTL boundary — valid at +9_999, reprocess at +10_001 (setup `ttl_ms: 10_000`); distinct keys distinct records; error caching creates 0 records; cleanup keeps 50 payment records but drops keys (asserts via `:sys.get_state`); interleaved idem/non-idem counts; sequential unique ids.
- **Notable**: test injects `Clock` Agent as `:clock`; drives cleanup by `send(pid, :cleanup)` then `:sys.get_state` to sync.

### 024 webhook_receiver_with_signature_verification — HMAC Webhook Receiver (UNSOLVED, Plug)
- **Interface**: `WebhookReceiver.Router` (`Plug.Router`) `POST /api/webhooks/stripe`, init opts `:secret`, `:store`. `WebhookReceiver.Signature.verify(payload, signature, secret)`→`:ok|:error`. `WebhookReceiver.Store` behaviour callbacks `store_event/3`→`{:ok,:duplicate|:created}`, `get_event/2`→`{:ok,event}|:error`, `all_events/1`. `WebhookReceiver.MemoryStore` GenServer impl.
- **Approach (required)**: signature = `:crypto.mac(:hmac,:sha256,secret,payload)` hex-encoded, **constant-time** compare. Router: read raw body (custom body reader or cache in assigns — needed for both verify AND decode), header `stripe-signature`; missing/empty/mismatch→401 `{"error":"invalid_signature"}`; then `Jason.decode`, extract `"id"`; malformed JSON or missing id→400 `{"error":"bad_payload"}`; new→store status `:pending`, 200 `{"status":"received"}`; duplicate id→200 `{"status":"duplicate"}`. Event map `%{event_id, payload(decoded map), status: :pending}`.
- **Key invariants tested**: tampered payload→401; duplicate by id even with different body (original payload preserved, not overwritten); 5 distinct ids stored independently; `Signature.verify` direct (`:ok`, wrong→`:error`, non-hex garbage→`:error`); GET to webhook path→404/405; unknown path→404. Test signs with `Base.encode16(case: :lower)`.
- **Notable**: raw-body preservation is the crux (Plug consumes body); tests build a throwaway `defmodule :"TestRouter_#{unique}"` then actually call `Router.init/1`+`call/2` directly.

### 025 long_polling_endpoint — Long-Polling Notifications (UNSOLVED, OTP + Plug)
- **Interface**: `Notifications.start_link(name: Notifications)`; `subscribe(server \\ Notifications, user_id)` (delivers `{:notification, payload}` to caller); `publish(server \\ Notifications, user_id, payload)`→`:ok`. `NotificationPoller` plug `GET /api/notifications/poll` opts `:notifications_server`, `:timeout_ms` (default 30_000). `NotificationRouter` (`Plug.Router`, `:match`/`:dispatch`) forwards poll route, 404 else, passes opts through.
- **Approach (required)**: pub/sub via `Registry` in `:duplicate` mode (no Phoenix.PubSub). Poller reads `conn.assigns.user_id`; missing→401 body `"unauthorized"`; subscribes then **blocking `receive … after timeout_ms`**; notification within timeout→200 `application/json` JSON-encoded payload; timeout→204 empty body. Must truly block (no sleep-poll loop).
- **Key invariants tested**: publish during in-flight poll returns 200 payload; no publish→204 empty; missing user_id→401; per-user isolation (A's publish doesn't wake B, B times out 204); correct routing among multiple pollers; multiple pollers same user all get it (duplicate registry); only first notification returned (single-shot, `seq:1` not `seq:2`); unicode/nested payloads; publish to no subscribers doesn't crash; unknown path→404; direct subscribe/publish delivers `{:notification, map}`.
- **Notable**: tests use `Task.async` + `Process.sleep(100)` to interleave subscribe/publish, short `timeout_ms: 500`.

### 102 genserver_based_state_machine_with_persistence — Persisted State Machine (SOLVED)
- **Interface**: `StateMachine.start_link(opts)` (opts `:repo` required, `:name` optional); `start(server, entity_id)`→`{:ok, state}` (hydrate from DB or `:pending`); `get_state/2`→`{:ok,state}|{:error,:not_found}` (in-memory only); `transition(server, entity_id, event)`→`{:ok,new}|{:error,:invalid_transition|:not_found|{:db_error,reason}}`; `history/2`→`{:ok,[%{event,from_state,to_state,inserted_at}]}` chronological. Plus `EntityTransition` Ecto schema (`entity_transitions` table) + migration.
- **Approach**: transition table is compile-time `@transitions` map keyed `{state, event}` (pending+confirm→confirmed, confirmed+ship→shipped, shipped+deliver→delivered, pending/confirmed+cancel→cancelled); `@initial_state :pending`. State = `%{repo:, entities: %{id => state_atom}}`. **All ops are `handle_call`** so concurrent callers serialize (no races); `transition` uses `with` pipeline `entity_lookup → resolve_transition → persist` and only updates in-memory map **after** DB insert succeeds. `persist/5` wraps `repo.insert(changeset)` in try/rescue → `{:db_error, reason}` on failure, never mutating state. `load_latest_state` = `order_by desc inserted_at, limit 1`; string columns re-atomized via `String.to_existing_atom` (safety: `@states` kept alive by `__states__/0`). Schema uses `@timestamps_opts [type: :utc_datetime_usec, updated_at: false]`.
- **Key invariants tested**: new entity→`:pending`; full happy path; both cancel paths; invalid/terminal transitions leave state unchanged & write nothing; transition on unknown entity→`:not_found`; history ordered & per-entity scoped; **restart recovery** (kill GenServer, new one re-hydrates `:shipped` from DB then accepts `:deliver`); **concurrency** — 20 concurrent `:confirm` on same entity yield exactly 1 `{:ok,:confirmed}` + 19 `:invalid_transition`; concurrent transitions on different entities all succeed.
- **Notable**: test ships a `FakeRepo` Agent-backed in-memory shim mimicking `insert/1`,`all/2`,`one/2` incl. crude `Ecto.Query` where-param extraction — solution deliberately avoids `select:` so real repo and FakeRepo both return full structs; `async: false`.

## Notable findings, caveats & gotchas

Things that are non-obvious or that surfaced during the per-family deep read above:

- **Dead `ElixirBenchmark.Repo` reference.** `test/test_helper.exs` conditionally starts
  `ElixirBenchmark.Repo`, but no such module exists in `lib/`. It's harmless because `:database`
  is excluded by default and no harness is tagged `:database`. The DB-touching tasks (032 Ecto
  ingestion, 102 state machine) instead spin **in-memory SQLite** or a **fake repo Agent** inside
  their own harness — they don't rely on the project-level repo.
- **Only one alternate-model solution exists** and it is a *negative* example: the Qwen3.5-4B trie
  (`tasks/076_001_trie_01/solution_Qwen3.5-4B-Q6_K_gguf.ex`) does not compile/pass and lacks
  moduledoc/spec/doc — it exists to illustrate the house style by contrast and to exercise the
  `run_all.exs <solution_filename>` multi-solution mechanism.
- **Latent bugs the harnesses don't catch.** A few solutions pass only because tests assert a weaker
  property than the prompt implies:
  - `001_004_penalty_escalation` cleanup uses `Enum.take_while(ts > now)`, effectively dropping all
    real (past) timestamps in the sweep (because `window_ms` isn't available in `:cleanup`); the
    harness only checks a "fresh key behaves cleanly" property. The solution also carries emoji
    self-fix comments (`# ✅ FIX…`), evidence of iterative debugging.
  - `007_004_cusumanomaly` diverges from its prompt: after an alert it *freezes* the stream
    (`alerted: true`, returns `:warming_up`) until an explicit `reset`, rather than
    reset-and-re-learn immediately; it also has an undocumented near-zero-variance guard.
  - `012_002_subscription` adds an unspecified `:not_active` rule for cancel-from-pending.
- **Boundary conventions vary intentionally per task** and are load-bearing in tests: sliding-window
  limiters assert `retry_after` in a *range*, fixed-window assert it *exactly*; `098` token expiry is
  strict `<` (equal = expired); `626` TSDB uses inclusive `query` bounds but half-open aggregation
  windows. Read each harness for the exact inequality.
- **Determinism is achieved two ways.** Time-based families inject a fake `Clock` Agent and drive
  `:cleanup` manually (fully deterministic). A handful of concurrency families (009, 061–064) instead
  use real `Process.sleep`/`:timer.tc` + `Agent` counters and assert timing bands — these are the
  least deterministic harnesses.
- **The `_02+` FIM dirs have no harness**, so they are *not* scored by `run_all.exs` (which globs on
  `test_harness.exs`). They are pure training material; correctness is implicitly guaranteed because
  each FIM `solution.ex` is lifted verbatim from an already-passing `_01` module.
- **Seven `tasks_multifile/` tasks are unsolved** (019–025: `prompt.md` + `test_harness.exs`, no
  `solution.ex`) — a ready-made backlog of harnessed-but-unimplemented tasks.
- **The idea catalog is ~94% unrealized.** `tasks.md` + `tasks_external.md` enumerate ~1000 base ideas
  (plus ~51 written variations); only ~57 base ideas (IDs mostly ≤101, plus 623–626) have been built.
  Treat the two `.md` files as a roadmap/backlog, not an index of what exists.

Adding tasks is normally done by the automated loop (`scripts/generate.exs` — README
"Automated generation loop"; design in `docs/04`), which authors, grades, repairs, and gates
each task. The README's manual step-by-step workflow (and the `tasks/*.md` meta-prompts it
references) is historical. If you hand-edit any existing `_01` task, remember the cascade
(FIM/wt_/tfim carriers embed its text verbatim) and re-run the family gates — see
`docs/10` §7 invariants.
