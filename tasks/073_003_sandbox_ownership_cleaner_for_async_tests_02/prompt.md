Implement the public `lookup/1` function. It resolves which checked-out connection
should serve a given `pid` (defaulting to `self()`). First call `ensure_registry()`
so the named ownership Agent is running. Then, inside a single `Agent.get/2` on the
registry, resolve the connection by checking the following, in order, and returning
`{:ok, conn}` for the first match:

  1. **Direct ownership** — if `pid` is itself a key in `owners`, return that owner's
     connection.
  2. **Explicit allowance** — if `pid` has been allowed onto some owner (i.e. it maps
     to an `owner` in the `allow` map) and that `owner` still owns a connection,
     return the owner's connection.
  3. **Global shared owner** — if a `shared` owner is set and still owns a connection,
     return the shared owner's connection.

If none of these match, return `:error`.

```elixir
defmodule DBCleaner do
  @moduledoc """
  Ecto-Sandbox-style ownership model that lets asynchronous integration tests
  share sandboxed connections across processes.

  Per-process state (which connection *this* process checked out) lives in the
  process dictionary. The cross-process ownership map lives in a single named
  Agent registry shaped as:

      %{owners: %{pid => conn}, allow: %{allowed_pid => owner_pid}, shared: pid | nil}

  `lookup/1` resolves a process to a connection by checking, in order:
  direct ownership, explicit allowance, then the global shared owner.
