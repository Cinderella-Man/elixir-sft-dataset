# Adapt existing code to a new specification

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir solution to a related task. Do not
start from scratch: treat it as the codebase you have been asked to change.
Modify it to satisfy the new specification that follows — keep whatever carries
over, and change, add, or remove whatever the new specification requires.

Where the existing code and the new specification disagree (module name, public
API, behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Give me
the complete final result.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule RecordDiff do
  @moduledoc """
  Compares two versions of a record list keyed by a unique ID field and
  produces a structured diff describing what was added, removed, or changed.

  ## Example

      iex> old = [%{id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30}, %{id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 25}]
      iex> new = [%{id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 31}, %{id: 3, name: "Carol", age: 28}]
      iex> RecordDiff.diff(old, new)
      %{
        added:   [%{id: 3, name: "Carol", age: 28}],
        removed: [%{id: 2, name: "Bob",   age: 25}],
        changed: [%{id: 1, changes: %{age: {30, 31}}}]
      }
  """

  @doc """
  Compares `old_list` and `new_list` (both lists of maps) and returns a
  structured diff map.

  ## Options

    * `:key` — the atom key used as the unique record identifier.
      Defaults to `:id`.

  ## Return value

  A map with the following keys:

    * `:added`   — records present in `new_list` but absent in `old_list`.
    * `:removed` — records present in `old_list` but absent in `new_list`.
    * `:changed` — one entry per record that exists in both lists but differs.
      Each entry is a map containing the key field's value and a `:changes`
      sub-map of `%{field => {old_value, new_value}}`.

  Fields that appear in only one version of a record are still reported as
  changes, using the atom `:missing` as a placeholder for the absent value.

## New specification

**Summary:** Implement an Elixir module `RecordMerge` that performs a three-way merge (the diff3 problem applied to lists of maps) of record lists keyed by ID: given a common ancestor plus two independently edited versions, produce the merged result and report the conflicts it could not resolve automatically.

**Public API**
- `RecordMerge.merge(base_list, ours_list, theirs_list, opts \\ [])` — all three arguments are lists of maps.
- Accepts a `:key` option, an atom specifying which field is the unique identifier; defaults to `:id`.
- Returns a map with two keys:
  - `:merged` — list of successfully merged records, sorted ascending by key value. Conflicted and deleted records are NOT included here.
  - `:conflicts` — list of conflict descriptors, sorted ascending by key value.

**Resolution rules (per id, from its presence/value in base `b`, ours `o`, theirs `t`)**
- Added on one side only (absent in base): take that side's record into `:merged`.
- Added on both sides (absent in base, present in ours and theirs): if `o == t`, take it; otherwise emit a conflict `%{key => id, type: :add_add, ours: o, theirs: t}`.
- Deleted on both sides (in base, absent in ours and theirs): drop it (no merged record, no conflict).
- Deleted on one side, unchanged on the other (e.g. absent in ours, and `t == b`): drop it.
- Deleted on one side, modified on the other: emit `%{key => id, type: :delete_modify, deleted_by: :ours | :theirs, modified: <the surviving modified record>}`.

**Present in base, ours, and theirs — field-level three-way merge over the union of fields (use `:missing` for a field absent on a side)**
- if `ov == tv`, keep that value;
- else if `ov == bv`, keep theirs (`tv`);
- else if `tv == bv`, keep ours (`ov`);
- else this field conflicts.
- A field whose resolved value is `:missing` is omitted from the merged record (it was deleted).
- If any field conflicts, emit `%{key => id, type: :modify_modify, fields: %{field => %{base: bv, ours: ov, theirs: tv}}}` (only the conflicting fields) and produce NO merged record for that id; otherwise put the reconstructed record into `:merged`.

**Constraints**
- Function must be pure — no processes, no state, no side effects.
- Use only the Elixir standard library.
- Deliver the complete module in a single file.
