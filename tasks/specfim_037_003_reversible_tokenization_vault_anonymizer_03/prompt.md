# Write the missing @spec

Below is a complete, working module — except that the `@spec` for
`detokenize/2` has been removed; its place is marked `# TODO: @spec`.
Write exactly that typespec: one `@spec` attribute for `detokenize/2`,
consistent with the function's arguments, guards, and every return shape
the implementation can produce. Change nothing else.

## The module with the `@spec` for `detokenize/2` missing

```elixir
defmodule Anonymizer do
  @moduledoc """
  Reversible pseudonymization (tokenization) of record fields with a vault.

  `tokenize/2` replaces each unique original value of a listed field with a
  stable opaque token (`"TOK_<FIELD>_<n>"`, `n` assigned in first-seen order)
  and returns `{tokenized_records, vault}`. `detokenize/2` uses the vault to
  restore originals, leaving any non-token value untouched. The round trip is
  lossless. Only OTP/stdlib modules are used.
  """

  @type vault :: %{forward: map(), reverse: map(), counters: map()}

  @doc """
  Pseudonymizes `fields` across `records`.

  Each unique original value of a listed field is replaced by a stable opaque
  token of the form `"TOK_<FIELD>_<n>"`, where `<FIELD>` is the uppercased
  field name and `<n>` is a per-field, first-seen counter. Distinct fields use
  distinct namespaces even for equal values. Fields not listed, and listed
  fields absent from a record, are left untouched.

  Returns `{tokenized_records, vault}`, where `vault` is an opaque term that
  records the mapping needed to reverse the transformation.

Give me only the `@spec` attribute — the attribute alone (however many
lines it spans), not the whole module.
