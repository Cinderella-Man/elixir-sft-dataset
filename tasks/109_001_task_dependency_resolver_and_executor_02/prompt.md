# Fill in the middle: `build_layers/3`

The module below is a complete, working `TaskRunner` `GenServer` — a task
dependency resolver that runs independent tasks concurrently — **except** for the
private helper `build_layers/3`, whose bodies have been replaced with `# TODO`.

Implement `build_layers/3`. It is the core of the layered topological sort
(Kahn's algorithm) used by `topological_layers/1`. It receives:

  * `in_degree` — a map from `task_id` to the number of still-unresolved
    dependencies that task is waiting on.
  * `dependents` — a map from a `task_id` to the list of tasks that directly
    depend on it (the reverse edges).
  * `layers` — an accumulator of already-computed layers, stored in **reverse**
    order (most recent layer first).

It must behave as follows:

  * **Base case:** when `in_degree` is empty (`map_size == 0`), every task has
    been placed into a layer. Return `{:ok, layers}` with the accumulated layers
    put back into forward order (i.e. `Enum.reverse(layers)`).

  * **Recursive case:** compute `ready`, the list of task ids whose in-degree is
    currently `0` (all dependencies resolved).
    * If `ready` is empty while tasks still remain, no task can make progress, so
      the remaining tasks form or feed a cycle. Return
      `{:error, {:cycle, involved}}` where `involved` is the list of the
      still-remaining task ids (`Map.keys(in_degree)`).
    * Otherwise, `ready` is the next layer. Remove those ids from `in_degree`,
      then for every task that depends on a ready id (looked up in `dependents`)
      decrement its in-degree by 1 — but only if it is still present in the
      remaining map. Recurse with the updated in-degree map, the same
      `dependents`, and `ready` prepended to `layers`.

Give me back the whole module with `build_layers/3` implemented.

```elixir
defmodule TaskRunner do
  @moduledoc """
  A `GenServer` that accepts tasks with dependencies and executes them in a
  valid topological order, running independent tasks concurrently.

  Tasks are registered with `submit/3` and only executed once `run_all/1` is
  called. Execution proceeds layer by layer: every task in a layer has all of
  its dependencies satisfied and none of the tasks in the same layer depend on
  one another, so they are run in parallel. As a result a wide layer of
  independent tasks takes roughly as long as the single slowest task in that
  layer.

  # ── Public API ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Starts the runner.

  Accepts a `:name` option used for process registration so the process can be
  referred to by an atom name in the other functions.

  @doc """
  Registers a task with the runner.

  `opts` is a keyword list with:

    * `:depends_on` — list of `task_id`s this task depends on (default `[]`).
    * `:func` — a zero-arity function to execute (required).

  Submitting the same `task_id` again overwrites the previous definition.
  Returns `:ok`.

  Validates the dependency graph and executes all submitted tasks.

  Returns `{:ok, results}` on success, where `results` maps each `task_id` to
  the value returned by its `:func`.

  Returns `{:error, {:unknown_dependencies, missing}}` if any task depends on a
  `task_id` that was never submitted, and `{:error, {:cycle, involved}}` if the
  graph contains a cycle. In both error cases no task is executed.
