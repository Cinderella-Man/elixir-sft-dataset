  @doc """
  Appends a named step to the saga.

  ## Parameters

    * `saga`          – the saga to extend.
    * `name`          – an atom that uniquely identifies the step. The
                        step's result will be stored in the context under
                        this key.
    * `action_fn`     – `(context -> {:ok, result} | {:error, reason})`.
                        Receives the current accumulated context.
    * `compensate_fn` – `(context -> any)`. Receives the context at the
                        point of failure. Its return value is recorded but
                        never causes a failure; any exception is caught and
                        recorded instead.

  Steps are executed in the order they are added.
