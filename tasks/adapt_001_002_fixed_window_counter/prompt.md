# Adapt existing code to a new specification

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir solution to a related task. Do not
start from scratch: treat it as the codebase you have been asked to change.
Modify it to satisfy the new specification that follows — keep whatever carries
over, and change, add, or remove whatever the new specification requires.

Where the existing code and the new specification disagree (module name, public
API, behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Give me
the complete final result.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule RateLimiter do
  @moduledoc """
  A GenServer that enforces per-key rate limits using a sliding window algorithm.

  Each key is tracked independently via a list of request timestamps.
  On every `check/4` call, timestamps outside the current window are pruned,
  and the request is allowed only if the remaining count is within the limit.

  Expired entries are garbage-collected on a configurable periodic sweep so the
  process never leaks memory for keys that stop receiving traffic.

  ## Options

    * `:name`                 – process registration name (optional)
    * `:clock`                – zero-arity function returning current time in ms
                                (default: `fn -> System.monotonic_time(:millisecond) end`)
    * `:cleanup_interval_ms`  – how often the periodic sweep runs in ms (default: 60_000)

  ## Examples

      iex> {:ok, pid} = RateLimiter.start_link([])
      iex> {:ok, 4} = RateLimiter.check(pid, "user:1", 5, 1_000)
      iex> {:ok, 3} = RateLimiter.check(pid, "user:1", 5, 1_000)

## New specification

Write me an Elixir GenServer module called `FixedWindowLimiter` that enforces per-key rate limits using a fixed-window counter algorithm.

I need these functions in the public API:

- `FixedWindowLimiter.start_link(opts)` to start the process. It should accept a `:clock` option which is a zero-arity function returning the current time in milliseconds. If not provided, default to `fn -> System.monotonic_time(:millisecond) end`. It should also accept a `:name` option for process registration.

- `FixedWindowLimiter.check(server, key, max_requests, window_ms)` which checks whether a request for the given key is allowed. The algorithm works by snapping time into discrete fixed windows: the window a timestamp belongs to is `div(timestamp, window_ms)`. Each `{key, window_index}` pair has an independent counter. If the counter for the current window is below max_requests, the request is allowed and the counter is incremented — return `{:ok, remaining}`. If the counter has reached max_requests, return `{:error, :rate_limited, retry_after_ms}` where retry_after_ms is the time until the current window ends (when the counter resets).

Each key must be tracked independently — rate limiting "user:1" should have no effect on "user:2". Windows are absolute, not relative: with a 1000ms window, timestamps 0-999 belong to window 0, 1000-1999 belong to window 1, and so on. This means the counter resets abruptly at window boundaries. Note that this is a known property of fixed-window counters: a client could send max_requests at t=999 and max_requests again at t=1000, effectively doubling the rate at the boundary. That behavior is acceptable for this implementation — do not try to smooth it out.

You also need to make sure expired counter entries get cleaned up so the GenServer doesn't leak memory over time. Run a periodic cleanup using `Process.send_after` every 60 seconds (configurable via `:cleanup_interval_ms` option) that removes any counter whose window has fully ended (window_end_time < current time).

Give me the complete module in a single file. Use only OTP standard library, no external dependencies.

## Additional interface contract

- The `:cleanup_interval_ms` option may also be `:infinity`, in which case the periodic
  timer is never scheduled — nothing runs automatically.

- Sending the server process a bare `:cleanup` message performs one cleanup
  pass immediately — the same work the periodic timer performs.
