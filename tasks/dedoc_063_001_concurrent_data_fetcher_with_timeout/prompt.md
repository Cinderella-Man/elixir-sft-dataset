# Document this module

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir module. Its behavior is correct
and must not change — but every piece of documentation has been stripped.

Add the missing documentation and typespecs:

- a `@moduledoc` that explains what the module does and how it is used,
- a `@doc` for every public function,
- a `@spec` for every public function (add `@type`s where they make the
  specs clearer).

Do not change any behavior: every function clause, guard, and expression
must keep working exactly as it does now. Do not rename anything, do not
"improve" the code, and do not add or remove functions. Give me the
complete documented module in a single file.

## The module

```elixir
defmodule ConcurrentFetcher do
  def fetch_all([], _timeout_ms), do: %{}

  def fetch_all(sources, timeout_ms)
      when is_list(sources) and is_integer(timeout_ms) and timeout_ms >= 0 do
    # ── 1. Spawn every fetch concurrently ──────────────────────────────────
    # Task.async/1 links the task to the caller, which lets us kill it later
    # via Task.shutdown/2. We pair each Task struct with its source name so we
    # can reconstruct the result map afterwards.
    tagged_tasks =
      Enum.map(sources, fn {name, fetch_fn} ->
        task = Task.async(fn -> safe_call(fetch_fn) end)
        {name, task}
      end)

    tasks = Enum.map(tagged_tasks, fn {_name, task} -> task end)

    # ── 2. Wait for all tasks under the global timeout ─────────────────────
    # Task.yield_many/2 blocks for at most `timeout_ms` milliseconds and then
    # returns a list of {task, result_or_nil} pairs in the same order as the
    # input list.  A nil result means the task did not finish in time.
    yield_results = Task.yield_many(tasks, timeout_ms)

    # ── 3. Reconcile each task's outcome ──────────────────────────────────
    # Build a map from task reference → final result_tuple first, then
    # re-attach names.
    ref_to_result =
      Enum.reduce(yield_results, %{}, fn {task, yield_outcome}, acc ->
        result =
          case yield_outcome do
            # Task completed within the timeout window.
            {:ok, {:ok, value}} ->
              {:ok, value}

            # Task completed but returned an application-level error.
            {:ok, {:error, reason}} ->
              {:error, reason}

            # Task exited/raised before the timeout fired.
            {:exit, reason} ->
              {:error, reason}

            # Timeout: the task is still running — shut it down immediately.
            # Task.shutdown/2 sends an exit signal and waits for the process
            # to terminate, so no zombie processes are left behind.
            nil ->
              Task.shutdown(task, :brutal_kill)
              {:error, :timeout}
          end

        Map.put(acc, task.ref, result)
      end)

    # ── 4. Rebuild the caller-facing map keyed by source name ─────────────
    Map.new(tagged_tasks, fn {name, task} ->
      {name, Map.fetch!(ref_to_result, task.ref)}
    end)
  end

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Private helpers
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Wraps the user-supplied fetch function so that any exception or unexpected
  # return value is normalised into {:ok, _} | {:error, _} without leaking raw
  # EXIT signals to the caller.
  defp safe_call(fetch_fn) do
    case fetch_fn.() do
      {:ok, _} = ok -> ok
      {:error, _} = err -> err
      other -> {:error, {:unexpected_return, other}}
    end
  rescue
    exception -> {:error, exception}
  catch
    kind, value -> {:error, {kind, value}}
  end
end
```
