# Restore the documentation

The module below works and is fully tested — its behavior is final. What it
lost is every piece of documentation. Put it back:

- a `@moduledoc` covering purpose and usage,
- a `@doc` on each public function,
- a `@spec` on each public function (plus `@type`s where they clarify).

And keep your hands off the code itself: no renames, no refactors, no added
or removed functions, identical behavior everywhere. Return the whole
documented module in one file.

## The module

```elixir
defmodule ConcurrentFetcher do
  def fetch_all([], _timeout_ms), do: %{}

  def fetch_all(sources, timeout_ms)
      when is_list(sources) and is_integer(timeout_ms) and timeout_ms >= 0 do
    # ── 1. Spawn every fetch concurrently ──────────────────────────────────
    # Task.async/1 links the task to the caller, which lets us kill it later
    # via Task.shutdown/2. We pair each Task struct with its source name so we
    # can reconstruct the result map afterwards.
    tagged_tasks =
      Enum.map(sources, fn {name, fetch_fn} ->
        task = Task.async(fn -> safe_call(fetch_fn) end)
        {name, task}
      end)

    tasks = Enum.map(tagged_tasks, fn {_name, task} -> task end)

    # ── 2. Wait for all tasks under the global timeout ─────────────────────
    # Task.yield_many/2 blocks for at most `timeout_ms` milliseconds and then
    # returns a list of {task, result_or_nil} pairs in the same order as the
    # input list.  A nil result means the task did not finish in time.
    yield_results = Task.yield_many(tasks, timeout_ms)

    # ── 3. Reconcile each task's outcome ──────────────────────────────────
    # Build a map from task reference → final result_tuple first, then
    # re-attach names.
    ref_to_result =
      Enum.reduce(yield_results, %{}, fn {task, yield_outcome}, acc ->
        result =
          case yield_outcome do
            # Task completed within the timeout window.
            {:ok, {:ok, value}} ->
              {:ok, value}

            # Task completed but returned an application-level error.
            {:ok, {:error, reason}} ->
              {:error, reason}

            # Task exited/raised before the timeout fired.
            {:exit, reason} ->
              {:error, reason}

            # Timeout: the task is still running — shut it down immediately.
            # Task.shutdown/2 sends an exit signal and waits for the process
            # to terminate, so no zombie processes are left behind.
            nil ->
              Task.shutdown(task, :brutal_kill)
              {:error, :timeout}
          end

        Map.put(acc, task.ref, result)
      end)

    # ── 4. Rebuild the caller-facing map keyed by source name ─────────────
    Map.new(tagged_tasks, fn {name, task} ->
      {name, Map.fetch!(ref_to_result, task.ref)}
    end)
  end

  # Wraps the user-supplied fetch function so that any exception or unexpected
  # return value is normalised into {:ok, _} | {:error, _} without leaking raw
  # EXIT signals to the caller.
  defp safe_call(fetch_fn) do
    case fetch_fn.() do
      {:ok, _} = ok -> ok
      {:error, _} = err -> err
      other -> {:error, {:unexpected_return, other}}
    end

    exception -> {:error, exception}
  catch
    kind, value -> {:error, {kind, value}}
