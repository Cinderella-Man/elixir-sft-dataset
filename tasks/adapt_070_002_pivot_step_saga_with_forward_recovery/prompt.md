# Migrate existing code to a new spec

Starting point: the working, tested solution below, from a related task.
Change it — no ground-up rewrite — until it satisfies the specification
that follows. On any disagreement between the two (module name, public API,
behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Output
the complete updated code.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule Saga do
  @moduledoc """
  Implements the Saga pattern for coordinating distributed transactions
  with automatic compensation on failure.

  ## Overview

  A saga is a sequence of named steps. Each step pairs a fallible
  *action* with an infallible *compensating action*. When any action
  fails, every action that already succeeded is compensated in reverse
  order, ensuring the system can be returned to a consistent state.

  ## Context threading

  Every action and compensating function receives the *accumulated*
  context map — the initial context merged with all results produced
  by steps that have run so far. A successful action's result is
  stored under the step's name:

      %{initial_key: value, reserve: reserve_result, charge: charge_result}

  Compensating functions receive the full context at the exact moment
  execution failed, so they have access to all data produced up to
  that point.

  ## Example

      saga =
        Saga.new()
        |> Saga.step(:reserve, &reserve_inventory/1, &release_inventory/1)
        |> Saga.step(:charge,  &charge_payment/1,   &refund_payment/1)
        |> Saga.step(:ship,    &create_shipment/1,   &cancel_shipment/1)

      case Saga.execute(saga, %{order_id: 42}) do
        {:ok, ctx} ->
          IO.inspect(ctx.ship, label: "shipment")

        {:error, failed_step, reason, compensations} ->
          IO.puts("Failed at \#{failed_step}: \#{inspect(reason)}")
          IO.inspect(compensations, label: "compensation results")
      end

  Appends a named step to the saga.

  ## Parameters

    * `saga`          – the saga to extend.
    * `name`          – an atom that uniquely identifies the step. The
                        step's result will be stored in the context under
                        this key.
    * `action_fn`     – `(context -> {:ok, result} | {:error, reason})`.
                        Receives the current accumulated context.
    * `compensate_fn` – `(context -> any)`. Receives the context at the
                        point of failure. Its return value is recorded but
                        never causes a failure; any exception is caught and
                        recorded instead.

  Steps are executed in the order they are added.

  @doc """
  Executes the saga against an initial `context` map.

  Steps run strictly in the order they were added. Each successful
  step merges its result into the context under the step's name before
  the next step begins.

  On failure the compensating functions for all *completed* steps run
  in **reverse order**. Failures (or exceptions) inside a compensating
  function are caught, recorded, and never abort the remaining
  compensations.

  ## Return values

    * `{:ok, final_context}` — all steps succeeded.
    * `{:error, failed_step_name, reason, compensation_results}` — the
      step named `failed_step_name` returned `{:error, reason}`. The
      `compensation_results` keyword list contains one entry per
      compensated step, in reverse execution order.

## New specification

Write me an Elixir module called `Saga` that implements the Saga pattern **with a pivot boundary and forward recovery**. Unlike a plain saga where every failure rolls everything back, this coordinator distinguishes two kinds of steps:

- **Compensable steps** — added with `Saga.step(saga, name, action_fn, compensate_fn)`. These come *before* the commit point and can be rolled back.
- **Retriable steps** — added with `Saga.retriable(saga, name, action_fn, max_attempts)`. These come *after* the commit point. They have no compensating action; instead, if the action fails it is retried (re-invoked with the same context) up to `max_attempts` total attempts. Retriable steps model post-commit work that must be driven *forward* to completion, not undone.

Public API:
- `Saga.new()` — creates a new, empty saga struct.
- `Saga.step(saga, name, action_fn, compensate_fn)` — appends a compensable step. `action_fn` is a 1-arity function receiving the context map and returning `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}`. `compensate_fn` is a 1-arity function receiving the context; its return value is recorded but never fails the compensation chain.
- `Saga.retriable(saga, name, action_fn, max_attempts)` — appends a retriable step. `max_attempts` is a positive integer; reject a non-positive value with a guard clause, so passing `0` or a negative number raises `FunctionClauseError`.
- `Saga.execute(saga, context)` — runs all steps in order, threading the context map (a successful step's result is merged under its name). On success, returns `{:ok, final_context}` — the accumulated context map (the original context for an empty saga).

Failure semantics:
- If a **compensable** step returns `{:error, reason}`, forward execution stops and the compensating actions of all previously completed **compensable** steps run in **reverse order**. Return `{:error, failed_step_name, reason, compensation_results}`, where `compensation_results` is a keyword list of `[step_name: compensate_return_value]` in reverse call order. Retriable steps are never compensated (they are post-commit).
- A **retriable** step that returns `{:error, reason}` is retried, re-invoking its action with the same context, until it returns `{:ok, result}` or `max_attempts` attempts have been made. On exhaustion, return `{:error, failed_step_name, {:retries_exhausted, last_reason}, []}` — note the empty compensation list, because committed compensable steps are **not** rolled back once the pivot has been crossed. `last_reason` is the reason from the final attempt.

Other behaviours to preserve:
- Steps run strictly in the order added; each action/compensation sees the accumulated context.
- A raising compensating function must not abort the remaining compensations; catch and record it (its recorded value may be any term).
- Plain module with a struct — no GenServer, no processes, no external dependencies.

Give me the complete implementation in a single file.
