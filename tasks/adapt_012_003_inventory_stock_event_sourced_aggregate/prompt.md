# Adapt existing code to a new specification

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir solution to a related task. Do not
start from scratch: treat it as the codebase you have been asked to change.
Modify it to satisfy the new specification that follows — keep whatever carries
over, and change, add, or remove whatever the new specification requires.

Where the existing code and the new specification disagree (module name, public
API, behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Give me
the complete final result.

## New specification

Write me an Elixir GenServer module called `InventoryAggregate` that maintains state through event sourcing for a product inventory domain.

I need these functions in the public API:

- `InventoryAggregate.start_link(opts)` to start the process. It should accept a `:name` option for process registration.

- `InventoryAggregate.execute(server, id, command)` which validates the command against the current state of the aggregate identified by `id`, produces zero or more events, applies them to the state, and persists them to an in-memory list. Commands are tuples: `{:register, product_name, sku}`, `{:receive_stock, quantity}`, `{:ship_stock, quantity}`, `{:adjust, quantity}`. If the command succeeds, return `{:ok, events}` where `events` is the list of new events produced by that command. If the command fails validation, return `{:error, reason}`.

- `InventoryAggregate.state(server, id)` which returns the current state of the aggregate. If the aggregate has never received a command, return `nil`. Otherwise return a map with at least `:name`, `:sku`, `:quantity_on_hand`, and `:status` keys (`:status` is `:registered` after registration).

- `InventoryAggregate.events(server, id)` which returns the full ordered list of events for that aggregate, oldest first.

The event sourcing logic should work as follows: each command is first validated against the current state, then zero or more event structs/maps are produced, then those events are applied one by one to the state, then they are appended to the event history. Events should be maps with at least a `:type` key. Use types like `:product_registered`, `:stock_received`, `:stock_shipped`, `:stock_adjusted`. Beyond `:type`, each event must carry the data relevant to it: the `:product_registered` event must include the product name (under `:name` or `:product_name`) and the `:sku`; the `:stock_received`, `:stock_shipped`, and `:stock_adjusted` events must each include a `:quantity` key holding the command's quantity — the signed value for adjustments (e.g. `-20` for `{:adjust, -20}`).

Validation rules:
- `:register` must fail with `{:error, :already_registered}` if the product is already registered.
- `:receive_stock` must fail with `{:error, :not_registered}` if the product hasn't been registered. Quantity must be positive or fail with `{:error, :invalid_quantity}`.
- `:ship_stock` must fail with `{:error, :not_registered}` if the product hasn't been registered. Quantity must be positive or fail with `{:error, :invalid_quantity}`. Must fail with `{:error, :insufficient_stock}` if quantity_on_hand is less than the shipment quantity.
- `:adjust` must fail with `{:error, :not_registered}` if the product hasn't been registered. Quantity can be positive or negative but not zero — fail with `{:error, :invalid_quantity}` if zero. Must fail with `{:error, :insufficient_stock}` if a negative adjustment would bring quantity_on_hand below zero.

Each aggregate `id` must be tracked independently — commands on `"prod:1"` should have no effect on `"prod:2"`.

Give me the complete module in a single file. Use only OTP standard library, no external dependencies.
