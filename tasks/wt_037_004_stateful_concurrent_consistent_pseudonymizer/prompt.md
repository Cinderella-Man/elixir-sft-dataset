# Write tests for this module

Below is a completed Elixir module and the original specification it was built to
satisfy. Write a comprehensive ExUnit test harness that verifies a correct
implementation of this module.

Requirements for the harness:
- Define a module `<Module>Test` that does `use ExUnit.Case, async: false`.
- Do NOT call `ExUnit.start()` — the evaluator starts ExUnit itself.
- Make it self-contained: any fakes, clock Agents, or helpers are defined inline.
- Cover the full public API and the important edge cases described in the spec.
- It must compile with ZERO warnings (prefix unused variables with `_`; match float
  zero as `+0.0`/`-0.0`).
- Give me the complete harness in a single file.

## Original specification

Write me an Elixir module called `Anonymizer` implemented as a **stateful GenServer** that anonymizes streams of records **concurrently** while guaranteeing referential integrity across every batch it has ever processed.

I need these functions in the public API:
- `Anonymizer.start_link(rules)` — start the server. `rules` is a map whose keys are field-name atoms and whose values are one of:
  - `{:pseudonym, prefix}` — replace the value with a stable sequential pseudonym `"<prefix>_<n>"` (e.g. `"PERSON_1"`), where `n` is assigned per field in first-seen order. The same original value always receives the same pseudonym, even across separate `anonymize/2` calls.
  - `:hash` — replace the value with its SHA-256 hex digest.
  - `:redact` — replace the value with `"[REDACTED]"`.
  Returns `{:ok, pid}`.
- `Anonymizer.anonymize(pid, records)` — transform a list of maps and return the transformed list **in the same order**. Records must be processed concurrently (e.g. with `Task.async_stream`), yet the transformation must remain race-free: within and across calls, identical original values for a pseudonymized field must always map to the identical pseudonym, and distinct values must map to distinct pseudonyms. Fields not named in `rules`, and rule fields missing from a given record, are left untouched.
- `Anonymizer.mapping(pid, field)` — return the current `%{original_value => pseudonym}` table accumulated for a pseudonymized `field`.

Because pseudonym numbering depends on first-seen order under concurrency, the exact number attached to any given value is not required to be deterministic across runs — only referential integrity, uniqueness, the `"<prefix>_<n>"` format, and stable cross-batch consistency are required.

Use only the Elixir/OTP standard library — no external dependencies. Give me the complete module in a single file.

## Module under test

```elixir
defmodule Anonymizer do
  @moduledoc """
  Stateful, concurrent anonymizer.

  A GenServer holds the accumulated `original -> pseudonym` tables so that
  referential integrity is preserved across every batch. `anonymize/2`
  processes records concurrently with `Task.async_stream` while all pseudonym
  assignment is serialized through the server, keeping it race-free. Supported
  rules: `{:pseudonym, prefix}`, `:hash`, `:redact`. Only OTP/stdlib is used.
