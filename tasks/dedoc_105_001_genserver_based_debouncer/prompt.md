# Document this module

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir module. Its behavior is correct
and must not change — but every piece of documentation has been stripped.

Add the missing documentation and typespecs:

- a `@moduledoc` that explains what the module does and how it is used,
- a `@doc` for every public function,
- a `@spec` for every public function (add `@type`s where they make the
  specs clearer).

Do not change any behavior: every function clause, guard, and expression
must keep working exactly as it does now. Do not rename anything, do not
"improve" the code, and do not add or remove functions. Give me the
complete documented module in a single file.

## The module

```elixir
defmodule Debouncer do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(opts) do
    name = Keyword.get(opts, :name, __MODULE__)
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{}, name: name)
  end

  def call(key, delay_ms, func)
      when is_integer(delay_ms) and delay_ms >= 0 and is_function(func, 0) do
    GenServer.cast(__MODULE__, {:debounce, key, delay_ms, func})
  end

  @impl true
  def init(state) do
    {:ok, state}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_cast({:debounce, key, delay_ms, func}, state) do
    # Cancel any pending timer for this key so the burst is coalesced. If the
    # old timer already fired, its message may be sitting in our queue —
    # cancellation cannot recall it, which is why every arm carries a unique
    # ref: handle_info/2 recognizes and drops the stale message.
    case Map.get(state, key) do
      {_ref, timer, _old_func} -> Process.cancel_timer(timer)
      nil -> :ok
    end

    ref = make_ref()
    timer = Process.send_after(self(), {:fire, key, ref}, delay_ms)
    {:noreply, Map.put(state, key, {ref, timer, func})}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_info({:fire, key, ref}, state) do
    case Map.get(state, key) do
      {^ref, _timer, func} ->
        # Run the func off the server's reduction path so a slow or crashing
        # func can't wedge the GenServer.
        spawn(fn -> func.() end)
        {:noreply, Map.delete(state, key)}

      _ ->
        # Stale fire: the key was re-debounced (or already fired) after this
        # timer's message was queued, so its func was replaced. Dropping the
        # message keeps the replacement's delay real.
        {:noreply, state}
    end
  end
end
```
