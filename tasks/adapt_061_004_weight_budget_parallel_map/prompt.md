# Migrate existing code to a new spec

Starting point: the working, tested solution below, from a related task.
Change it — no ground-up rewrite — until it satisfies the specification
that follows. On any disagreement between the two (module name, public API,
behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Output
the complete updated code.

  Applies a function to every element of a collection in parallel while

  Results are always returned in the same order as the input. If the
  function raises or the spawned process exits abnormally, the corresponding
  result is `{:error, reason}`; all other in-flight tasks continue
  unaffected.

  Scheduling is implemented with `Task.async`/`Task.yield_many` over a
  sliding window of at most `max_concurrency` tasks. `Task.async` links the
  task to the caller, so exits are trapped for the duration of the run (and
  restored afterwards): a crashing task then surfaces as a harmless
  `{:exit, reason}` yield result instead of killing the caller.

## New specification

Write me an Elixir module called `WeightedMap` that applies a function to a collection in
parallel, but where the concurrency limit is a **weight budget** rather than a simple task
count.

I need one public function:
- `WeightedMap.pmap(collection, func, weight_fun, budget)` where `weight_fun` maps an
  element to a **positive integer** weight and `budget` is a positive integer. It applies
  `func` to each element in parallel such that the **sum of the weights of all in-flight
  tasks never exceeds `budget`**. Results are returned in the **same order** as the input
  collection, regardless of completion order.

Admission rules:
- Admit elements in **strict input order (head-of-line blocking)**: only the element at the
  head of the queue is eligible to start, and it starts only once the currently running
  total weight plus its own weight is `<= budget`. If the head does not fit, nothing behind
  it may start — a lighter element further back must **not** jump ahead of a blocked heavier
  head.
- Special case: if a single element's weight is **greater than `budget`**, it would
  otherwise never run — so allow it to run **alone** (only when nothing else is currently
  running). While it runs, no other element may start.

Task crash handling: if `func` raises or the spawned task exits abnormally for a given
element, that element's result should be `{:error, reason}` — this must not affect or cancel
other in-flight tasks, and the element's weight must be released back to the budget.

You will also need to write a helper GenServer called `WeightMeter` in the same file. It must
expose:
- `WeightMeter.start_link(opts)` — starts the process, accepts `:name`
- `WeightMeter.add(server, weight)` — adds `weight` to the in-flight total, returns the new total
- `WeightMeter.sub(server, weight)` — subtracts `weight` from the in-flight total, returns the new total
- `WeightMeter.peak(server)` — returns the highest in-flight total the meter has ever reached

`WeightMeter` is intended for use in tests to verify that the weight budget is actually
respected at runtime; your `pmap` implementation itself does not need to use it.

Give me the complete implementation in a single file. Use only OTP and the standard library —
no external dependencies. Do not use `Task.async_stream`; implement the weight-aware
admission and scheduling logic yourself using `spawn_monitor`.

## Additional interface contract

- `pmap/4` validates weights: if `weight_fun` returns anything other than a positive
  integer for some element (e.g. `0`), it raises an `ArgumentError`.
