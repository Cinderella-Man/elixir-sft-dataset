# Adapt existing code to a new specification

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir solution to a related task. Do not
start from scratch: treat it as the codebase you have been asked to change.
Modify it to satisfy the new specification that follows — keep whatever carries
over, and change, add, or remove whatever the new specification requires.

Where the existing code and the new specification disagree (module name, public
API, behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Give me
the complete final result.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule Permissions do
  @moduledoc """
  Role-based access control with hierarchical roles and owner-based overrides.

  ## Role Hierarchy (least → most privileged)

      :viewer < :editor < :manager < :admin

  ## Rules Map Shape

      %{
        resource => %{
          action => required_role | :owner
        }
      }

  ## Owner Override

  When a rule is set to `:owner`, access is granted if and only if the
  `owner_id` and `user_id` supplied in `opts` are equal (and non-nil).
  The caller's role is irrelevant for `:owner`-gated actions.
  """

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Role hierarchy
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  @role_rank %{viewer: 0, editor: 1, manager: 2, admin: 3}

  @roles Map.keys(@role_rank)

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Public API
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  @doc """
  Returns `true` when `role` satisfies the rule for `{resource, action}` in
  `rules`, `false` otherwise (including unknown resources / actions).

  Equivalent to `can?(role, resource, action, rules, [])`.
  """
  @spec can?(atom(), atom(), atom(), map()) :: boolean()
  def can?(role, resource, action, rules) do
    can?(role, resource, action, rules, [])
  end

  @doc """
  Same as `can?/4` but accepts an `opts` keyword list.

  ## Options

  * `:owner_id` – the ID of whoever owns the resource.
  * `:user_id`  – the ID of the user requesting access.

  When the rule for `{resource, action}` is the atom `:owner`, access is
  granted if and only if `owner_id == user_id` (both must be present and
  equal). The caller's role plays no part in this decision.

  For all other rule values the options are ignored and normal role
  comparison applies.

  @spec can?(atom(), atom(), atom(), map(), keyword()) :: boolean()
  def can?(role, resource, action, rules, opts) do

## New specification

Write me an Elixir module called `Rbac` that resolves permissions for a **principal that can hold multiple roles at once**, using **`"resource:action"` permission strings with wildcard patterns**.

Roles are defined as a map from a role atom to a list of permission-pattern strings:

```elixir
%{
  viewer: ["posts:read", "comments:read"],
  editor: ["posts:read", "posts:write", "comments:read", "comments:write"],
  admin:  ["*:*"]
}
```

A permission pattern is a colon-separated string of two segments, `"<resource>:<action>"`, where either segment may be the literal `"*"` wildcard which matches any value in that position. Examples: `"posts:read"`, `"posts:*"`, `"*:read"`, `"*:*"`.

A **principal** is either:

- a plain list of role atoms, e.g. `[:viewer, :editor]`, or
- a map `%{roles: [atom], grants: [String.t()]}` where `:grants` is a list of extra permission-pattern strings granted directly to that principal (in addition to those from its roles). Missing `:roles` / `:grants` keys default to `[]`.

A principal's effective permissions are the **union** of the patterns from every role it holds plus its direct grants.

I need the following public API:

- `Rbac.effective_permissions(principal, role_defs)` — returns a `MapSet` of the principal's effective permission-pattern strings.
- `Rbac.permitted?(principal, resource, action, role_defs)` — takes `resource` and `action` as atoms, builds the target `"resource:action"`, and returns `true` if **any** effective pattern matches the target (segment by segment, with `"*"` matching anything), else `false`. Unknown roles contribute no permissions rather than raising.

Give me the complete module in a single file with no external dependencies.
