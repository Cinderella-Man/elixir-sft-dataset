  Records one event for `key` at the time returned by the configured clock.

  Implemented as a synchronous call so that the timestamp assigned to the event
  is read before control returns to the caller — this keeps semantics
  deterministic when callers advance a clock (or read the count) immediately
  after incrementing.
