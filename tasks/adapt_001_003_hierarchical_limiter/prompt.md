# Migrate existing code to a new spec

Starting point: the working, tested solution below, from a related task.
Change it — no ground-up rewrite — until it satisfies the specification
that follows. On any disagreement between the two (module name, public API,
behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Output
the complete updated code.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule RateLimiter do
  @moduledoc """
  A GenServer that enforces per-key rate limits using a sliding window algorithm.

  Each key is tracked independently via a list of request timestamps.
  On every `check/4` call, timestamps outside the current window are pruned,
  and the request is allowed only if the remaining count is within the limit.

  Expired entries are garbage-collected on a configurable periodic sweep so the
  process never leaks memory for keys that stop receiving traffic.

  ## Options

    * `:name`                 – process registration name (optional)
    * `:clock`                – zero-arity function returning current time in ms
                                (default: `fn -> System.monotonic_time(:millisecond) end`)
    * `:cleanup_interval_ms`  – how often the periodic sweep runs in ms (default: 60_000)

  ## Examples

      iex> {:ok, pid} = RateLimiter.start_link([])
      iex> {:ok, 4} = RateLimiter.check(pid, "user:1", 5, 1_000)
      iex> {:ok, 3} = RateLimiter.check(pid, "user:1", 5, 1_000)

## New specification

Write me an Elixir GenServer module called `HierarchicalLimiter` that enforces **multiple simultaneous** rate limits per key using a sliding window algorithm.

The motivation: real APIs often advertise tiered limits like "10 requests/second AND 100 requests/minute AND 1000 requests/hour". A request is only allowed if it passes **every** tier. This module enforces all tiers against the same stream of request timestamps.

I need these functions in the public API:

- `HierarchicalLimiter.start_link(opts)` to start the process. It should accept a `:clock` option which is a zero-arity function returning the current time in milliseconds. If not provided, default to `fn -> System.monotonic_time(:millisecond) end`. It should also accept a `:name` option for process registration.

- `HierarchicalLimiter.check(server, key, tiers)` where `tiers` is a non-empty list of `{tier_name, max_requests, window_ms}` tuples. For example: `[{:per_second, 10, 1_000}, {:per_minute, 100, 60_000}, {:per_hour, 1000, 3_600_000}]`. The tier_name is an atom used for reporting which tier was exceeded. If the request passes every tier, return `{:ok, remaining_by_tier}` where `remaining_by_tier` is a map like `%{per_second: 7, per_minute: 94, per_hour: 893}` — the remaining allowance under each tier after accepting this request. If any tier would be exceeded, return `{:error, :rate_limited, tier_name, retry_after_ms}` identifying the tightest tier that rejected the request and how long until that specific tier would admit a new request (i.e., long enough for enough of its oldest in-window timestamps to expire that the tier drops below its limit — which, when the tier is over by more than one, is longer than waiting for just the single oldest entry to expire). "Tightest" means the tier with the longest retry_after (i.e., the tier the caller needs to wait on). Do not record the timestamp when the request is rejected — a rejected request should not consume budget under any tier.

Each key must be tracked independently. Internally, keep a single list of timestamps per key (shared across tiers) and evaluate each tier against that list by counting entries within the tier's window. The widest tier's window determines how long timestamps must be retained; timestamps older than that window can be discarded. Remember the widest window ever seen for a key across all of its checks, so that a later check using only narrower tiers does not shrink how far back timestamps are retained — a check's own timestamps, and those recorded by earlier wide-tier checks, must remain available to a subsequent wide-tier check.

You also need to make sure expired entries get cleaned up so the GenServer doesn't leak memory over time. Run a periodic cleanup using `Process.send_after` every 60 seconds (configurable via `:cleanup_interval_ms` option) that prunes timestamps older than the widest window seen for each key, and drops keys whose timestamp list becomes empty.

Give me the complete module in a single file. Use only OTP standard library, no external dependencies.

## Additional interface contract

- The `:cleanup_interval_ms` option may also be `:infinity`, in which case the periodic
  timer is never scheduled — nothing runs automatically.

- Sending the server process a bare `:cleanup` message performs one cleanup
  pass immediately — the same work the periodic timer performs.
