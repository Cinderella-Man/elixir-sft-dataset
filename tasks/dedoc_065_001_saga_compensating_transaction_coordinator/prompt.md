# Document this module

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir module. Its behavior is correct
and must not change — but every piece of documentation has been stripped.

Add the missing documentation and typespecs:

- a `@moduledoc` that explains what the module does and how it is used,
- a `@doc` for every public function,
- a `@spec` for every public function (add `@type`s where they make the
  specs clearer).

Do not change any behavior: every function clause, guard, and expression
must keep working exactly as it does now. Do not rename anything, do not
"improve" the code, and do not add or remove functions. Give me the
complete documented module in a single file.

## The module

```elixir
defmodule Saga do
  defstruct steps: []

  def new, do: %__MODULE__{steps: []}

  def step(%__MODULE__{steps: steps} = saga, name, action, compensation)
      when is_function(action, 1) and is_function(compensation, 1) do
    %__MODULE__{
      saga
      | steps: steps ++ [%{name: name, action: action, compensation: compensation}]
    }
  end

  def execute(%__MODULE__{steps: steps}, context) when is_map(context) do
    forward(steps, context, [])
  end

  # Forward pass: execute each remaining step's action in order.
  #
  # `completed` accumulates the completed steps in reverse completion order
  # (most-recently-completed first), which is exactly the order needed for the
  # compensation pass.
  defp forward([], context, _completed), do: {:ok, context}

  defp forward([%{name: name, action: action} = step | rest], context, completed) do
    case action.(context) do
      {:ok, result} ->
        new_context = Map.put(context, name, result)
        forward(rest, new_context, [step | completed])

      {:error, reason} ->
        compensate(completed, context, name, reason)
    end
  end

  # Compensation pass: run each completed step's compensation in reverse
  # completion order (best-effort — errors are recorded but do not stop the pass).
  defp compensate(completed, context, failed_step, reason) do
    {compensated, compensations} =
      Enum.reduce(completed, {[], %{}}, fn %{name: name, compensation: compensation},
                                           {names, results} ->
        result = compensation.(context)
        {[name | names], Map.put(results, name, result)}
      end)

    {:error,
     %{
       step: failed_step,
       error: reason,
       compensated: Enum.reverse(compensated),
       compensations: compensations
     }}
  end
end
```
