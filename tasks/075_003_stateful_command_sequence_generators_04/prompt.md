# Task: Implement `stack_build/3`

`CommandGenerators` provides `StreamData` generators for **valid stateful command
sequences**, for model-based property testing. The stack generator threads a
symbolic model (just the stack *size*, since that is all the preconditions depend
on) while it builds a sequence, so that `:pop`/`:peek` are only ever emitted when
the modeled stack is non-empty.

Implement the private recursive helper `stack_build/3`, which builds a stack
command sequence one command at a time. Its arguments are:

- `n` — the number of commands still to generate,
- `size` — the current modeled stack size (the only piece of stack state the
  preconditions depend on),
- `acc` — the commands generated so far, accumulated in **reverse** order.

It must return a `%StreamData{}` generator that produces a list of commands.

Behavior:

- **Base case (`n == 0`):** there is nothing left to generate. Return a generator
  (`StreamData.constant/1`) that yields the accumulated commands restored to their
  original order (i.e. `Enum.reverse(acc)`).
- **Recursive case (`n > 0`):** generate a single valid command for the current
  state by binding (`StreamData.bind/2`) on `stack_command(size)`. For the drawn
  command `cmd`, continue building the rest of the sequence by recursing with:
  one fewer command remaining (`n - 1`), the stack size updated by applying the
  command (`stack_apply(size, cmd)`), and `cmd` prepended to the accumulator
  (`[cmd | acc]`).

Because each step's available commands are conditioned on `size` (via
`stack_command/1`), every generated program satisfies the no-underflow invariant
by construction.

```elixir
defmodule CommandGenerators do
  @moduledoc """
  `StreamData` generators for **valid stateful command sequences**, for use with
  model-based property testing via `StreamData` and `ExUnitProperties`.

  Each generator threads a *symbolic model* while it builds a sequence: at every
  step the set of commands offered is conditioned on the current model state, so
  a command's precondition is satisfied by construction. The result is that a
  consumer can run every generated program against a real system without ever
  filtering out invalid sequences.

  ## Usage

      use ExUnitProperties

      property "the stack never underflows" do
        check all program <- CommandGenerators.stack_program() do
          assert run_stack(program) != :underflow
        end
      end

  All generators return `%StreamData{}` structs and compose with the standard
  `StreamData` combinator API.
