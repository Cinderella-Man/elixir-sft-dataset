# Implement `call/3` for the `Debouncer` GenServer

Implement the public `call/3` function. It is the client-side entry point that
schedules a zero-arity function `func` to run after `delay_ms` milliseconds on
the given `key`. It must:

- Accept `key` (any term), `delay_ms` (a non-negative integer), and `func` (a
  zero-arity function). Guard the clause so it only matches when `delay_ms` is an
  integer `>= 0` and `func` is a function of arity 0.
- Not do any debouncing work itself — it simply hands the request off to the
  server. Send an asynchronous `GenServer.cast/2` (so the call returns promptly
  and never blocks waiting for `func` to run) carrying a `{:debounce, key,
  delay_ms, func}` message.
- Target the process registered under the default name `Debouncer` (i.e.
  `__MODULE__`).
- Return `:ok` (which is what `GenServer.cast/2` returns).

The actual timer scheduling, coalescing, and firing are handled by the
`handle_cast/2` and `handle_info/2` callbacks already present in the module.

```elixir
defmodule Debouncer do
  @moduledoc """
  A `GenServer` that debounces zero-arity function calls on a per-key basis.

  Rapid calls sharing the same key are coalesced: each new call for a key
  resets that key's timer and replaces the pending function, so only the most
  recently supplied function runs once the burst settles (after `delay_ms`
  elapses with no further calls for that key). Different keys are fully
  independent, each with their own timer and schedule.

  ## Example

      {:ok, _pid} = Debouncer.start_link([])

      # Only the last func runs, ~50ms after the final call.
      Debouncer.call(:save, 50, fn -> IO.puts("v1") end)
      Debouncer.call(:save, 50, fn -> IO.puts("v2") end)
      Debouncer.call(:save, 50, fn -> IO.puts("v3") end)
      #=> eventually prints "v3"
  """

  @doc """
  Starts the debouncer process.

  Accepts a `:name` option for process registration, defaulting to `Debouncer`
  (the module name) when not provided.

  end

  @doc """
  Schedules `func` (a zero-arity function) to run after `delay_ms` milliseconds
  on the given `key`.

  If another `call/3` for the same `key` arrives before the pending timer fires,
  the timer is reset and `func` replaces the previously pending function, so only
  the most recent `func` for a burst runs (exactly once).

  Returns `:ok` promptly without blocking on `func`. Targets the process
  registered under the name `Debouncer`.
