# Adapt existing code to a new specification

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir solution to a related task. Do not
start from scratch: treat it as the codebase you have been asked to change.
Modify it to satisfy the new specification that follows — keep whatever carries
over, and change, add, or remove whatever the new specification requires.

Where the existing code and the new specification disagree (module name, public
API, behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Give me
the complete final result.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule RingBuffer do
  @moduledoc """
  A fixed-size ring buffer implemented as a pure data structure.

  Internally, items are stored in a fixed-size tuple pre-allocated to
  `capacity` slots. Two integer indices — `write` (next slot to write)
  and `read` (oldest readable slot) — advance with `rem/2` so they wrap
  around automatically. `size` tracks the live item count independently,
  capping at `capacity`.

  When the buffer is full, `push/2` silently advances the read head
  alongside the write head, effectively discarding the oldest item.

## New specification

Write me an Elixir module called `ConcurrentRingBuffer` that implements a fixed-size overwriting ring buffer as a **GenServer**, so it can be shared safely across many concurrent processes (e.g. as a live log tail or a metrics sink).

Push semantics match a classic ring buffer: when the buffer is full, the oldest item is silently overwritten. All operations are serialized through the GenServer so concurrent writers never corrupt the buffer.

I need this public API (each function takes the server pid or registered name as its first argument):
- `ConcurrentRingBuffer.start_link(opts)` — starts the server. `opts` is a keyword list that MUST include `:capacity` (a positive integer) and MAY include `:name` for registration. Returns `{:ok, pid}`.
- `ConcurrentRingBuffer.push(server, item)` — inserts an item, overwriting the oldest when full. Returns `:ok`.
- `ConcurrentRingBuffer.to_list(server)` — returns all current items in insertion order (oldest to newest).
- `ConcurrentRingBuffer.size(server)` — returns the number of items currently stored (0 to capacity).
- `ConcurrentRingBuffer.peek_oldest(server)` — returns `{:ok, item}` for the oldest item, or `:error` if empty.
- `ConcurrentRingBuffer.peek_newest(server)` — returns `{:ok, item}` for the newest item, or `:error` if empty.
- `ConcurrentRingBuffer.flush(server)` — atomically returns all current items (oldest to newest) AND empties the buffer in a single operation, so a draining consumer never loses or double-reads items.

Internally the server state must store items in a fixed-size tuple (pre-allocated to `capacity` slots) with integer read/write head indices that wrap around using `rem/2`. Do not use a list or an `Enum`-grown structure as the primary store.

Give me the complete module in a single file. Use only the Elixir standard library (and OTP's `GenServer`) — no external dependencies.
