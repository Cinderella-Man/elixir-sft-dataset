# Adapt existing code to a new specification

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir solution to a related task. Do not
start from scratch: treat it as the codebase you have been asked to change.
Modify it to satisfy the new specification that follows — keep whatever carries
over, and change, add, or remove whatever the new specification requires.

Where the existing code and the new specification disagree (module name, public
API, behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Give me
the complete final result.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule Workflow do
  @moduledoc """
  A finite state machine for the lifecycle of an order.

  An order record is a plain map that always carries a `:state` key holding the
  current state atom. It moves through the following states:

      draft → submitted → approved → in_progress → completed

  with two side branches:

      submitted → rejected
      in_progress → cancelled

  The states `:completed`, `:rejected`, and `:cancelled` are terminal — no event
  can move an order out of them.

  This module is purely functional: it neither spawns nor relies on any
  processes, and it uses only the Elixir/OTP standard library.

## New specification

# Reversible Order Workflow with Undo & History

Write me an Elixir module called `Workflow` that defines and enforces a finite
state machine for the lifecycle of an order **and records every applied
transition so it can be undone**.

## States

Same lifecycle as a plain order workflow:

```
draft → submitted → approved → in_progress → completed
```

with two side branches:

```
submitted → rejected
in_progress → cancelled
```

The full set of states is:

`:draft`, `:submitted`, `:approved`, `:in_progress`, `:completed`,
`:rejected`, `:cancelled`.

`:completed`, `:rejected`, and `:cancelled` are **terminal** for *forward*
transitions — no event can move an order out of them. (Undo, described below,
is not a forward transition and *can* leave a terminal state.)

## Transition table

Each event is an atom and maps to exactly one `from → to` edge:

| event       | from          | to            |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| `:submit`   | `:draft`      | `:submitted`  |
| `:approve`  | `:submitted`  | `:approved`   |
| `:reject`   | `:submitted`  | `:rejected`   |
| `:start`    | `:approved`   | `:in_progress`|
| `:complete` | `:in_progress`| `:completed`  |
| `:cancel`   | `:in_progress`| `:cancelled`  |

## The record

A *record* is a plain map that always contains:

- a `:state` key holding the current state atom, and
- a `:history` key holding a list of the transitions applied so far.

Any other domain fields must be preserved untouched across transitions and
undos.

## Public API

- `Workflow.new(attrs \\ %{})` — build a new record. Returns `attrs` merged with
  `%{state: :draft, history: []}`. Both `:state` and `:history` provided in
  `attrs` (if any) are overridden — a new record always starts in `:draft` with
  an empty history. `attrs` is a map with atom keys.

- `Workflow.states/0` — return the list of all seven state atoms.

- `Workflow.transition(record, event)` — attempt a **forward** transition.
  - On success, return `{:ok, updated_record}` where `:state` is replaced by the
    destination state, a history entry is recorded (see below), and all other
    fields are preserved.
  - If `event` is not a valid transition out of the current state (terminal
    state, wrong stage, or unknown event), return
    `{:error, :invalid_transition, current_state, event}`.
  - If the event is a valid edge but its guard rejects the record, return
    `{:error, :guard_failed, current_state, event}` and leave the record
    unchanged. `:invalid_transition` takes precedence over the guard check.

- `Workflow.undo(record)` — revert the most recently applied transition.
  - If the history is empty, return `{:error, :nothing_to_undo}`.
  - Otherwise return `{:ok, updated_record}` with `:state` set back to the
    `from` state of the most recent entry and that entry removed from the
    history. Undo does **not** re-run guards, and it works even from a terminal
    state. Undo reverts only the `:state`; other domain fields are left as they
    are.

- `Workflow.history(record)` — return the list of event atoms that have been
  applied (and not undone), in **chronological order** (oldest first).

- `Workflow.can?(record, event)` — return `true` if
  `Workflow.transition(record, event)` would succeed, otherwise `false`.

## Guards

Encode exactly these two guards; all other transitions always pass:

- **`:submit`** (`:draft → :submitted`): passes only when the record's `:items`
  field is a non-empty list.

- **`:approve`** (`:submitted → :approved`): passes only when the record's
  `:approved_by` field is a non-empty binary (string).

## History entries

Each recorded history entry is a `{event, from_state, to_state}` tuple. You may
store the list in whatever internal order is convenient (e.g. most-recent
first), as long as `undo/1` reverts the latest transition and `history/1`
returns events oldest-first.

## Constraints

- Single file, module named `Workflow`.
- Use only the Elixir/OTP standard library — no external dependencies.
- No processes are required; this is a pure functional module.
