# Implement the missing function

Below is the complete specification of a task, followed by a working,
fully tested module that solves it — except that `submit` has been
removed: every clause body is blanked to `# TODO`. Implement exactly that
function so the whole module passes the task's full test suite again.
Change nothing else — every other function, attribute, and clause must
stay exactly as shown.

## The task

# Task Dependency Resolver and Executor

Write me an Elixir `GenServer` module called `TaskRunner` that accepts tasks with
dependencies and executes them in a valid order, running independent tasks
concurrently.

## Public API

- `TaskRunner.start_link(opts)` — starts the process. It must accept a `:name`
  option used for process registration (so the process can be referred to by an
  atom name in the other functions). Return the usual `{:ok, pid}`.

- `TaskRunner.submit(name, task_id, opts)` — registers a task with the runner.
  - `name` is the registered process name.
  - `task_id` is any term that uniquely identifies the task (typically an atom).
  - `opts` is a keyword list with:
    - `:depends_on` — a list of `task_id`s this task depends on. Optional,
      defaults to `[]`.
    - `:func` — a zero-arity function (`fn -> ... end`) to execute. Required.
  - Returns `:ok`. Submitting the same `task_id` again should overwrite the
    previous definition. Tasks are only *registered* by `submit/3`; none of the
    functions run until `run_all/1` is called.

- `TaskRunner.run_all(name)` — validates the dependency graph, then executes all
  submitted tasks.
  - It must perform a topological sort so that a task's `:func` only begins
    executing **after every one of its dependencies has finished executing**.
  - Tasks whose dependencies are all satisfied and that do not depend on one
    another must run **in parallel** (concurrently), not sequentially.
  - On success it returns `{:ok, results}` where `results` is a map from
    `task_id` to the value returned by that task's `:func`.
  - If the dependency graph contains a cycle, it must **not** execute any task
    and must return `{:error, {:cycle, involved}}`, where `involved` is a list of
    the `task_id`s participating in a cycle.
  - If any task lists a dependency that was never submitted, it must **not**
    execute any task and must return
    `{:error, {:unknown_dependencies, missing}}`, where `missing` is a list of
    the referenced-but-unknown `task_id`s.
  - Calling `run_all/1` on a runner with no submitted tasks returns `{:ok, %{}}`.

## Notes

- Use only the OTP standard library — no external dependencies.
- Give me the complete module in a single file.
- The design goal is correctness of ordering *and* real parallelism: a wide layer
  of independent tasks should take roughly as long as the single slowest task in
  that layer, not the sum of them.

## The module with `submit` missing

```elixir
defmodule TaskRunner do
  @moduledoc """
  A `GenServer` that accepts tasks with dependencies and executes them in a
  valid topological order, running independent tasks concurrently.

  Tasks are registered with `submit/3` and only executed once `run_all/1` is
  called. Execution proceeds layer by layer: every task in a layer has all of
  its dependencies satisfied and none of the tasks in the same layer depend on
  one another, so they are run in parallel. As a result a wide layer of
  independent tasks takes roughly as long as the single slowest task in that
  layer.
  """

  use GenServer

  referred to by an atom name in the other functions.

  Validates the dependency graph and executes all submitted tasks.

  Returns `{:ok, results}` on success, where `results` maps each `task_id` to

  Returns `{:error, {:unknown_dependencies, missing}}` if any task depends on a
  `task_id` that was never submitted, and `{:error, {:cycle, involved}}` if the
  graph contains a cycle. In both error cases no task is executed.

function alone, not the whole module.
