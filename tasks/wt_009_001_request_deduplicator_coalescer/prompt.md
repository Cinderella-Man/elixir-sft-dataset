# Write tests for this module

Below is a completed Elixir module and the original specification it was built to
satisfy. Write a comprehensive ExUnit test harness that verifies a correct
implementation of this module.

Requirements for the harness:
- Define a module `<Module>Test` that does `use ExUnit.Case, async: false`.
- Do NOT call `ExUnit.start()` — the evaluator starts ExUnit itself.
- Make it self-contained: any fakes, clock Agents, or helpers are defined inline.
- Cover the full public API and the important edge cases described in the spec.
- It must compile with ZERO warnings (prefix unused variables with `_`; match float
  zero as `+0.0`/`-0.0`).
- Give me the complete harness in a single file.

## Original specification

Write me an Elixir GenServer module called `Dedup` that deduplicates concurrent identical requests so that only one execution happens per key at a time.

I need these functions in the public API:

- `Dedup.start_link(opts)` to start the process. It should accept a `:name` option for process registration.

- `Dedup.execute(server, key, func)` where `func` is a zero-arity function. If no execution is currently in flight for the given `key`, the function is executed (asynchronously, so the GenServer isn't blocked) and the caller blocks until the result is ready. If another caller calls `execute` with the same key while the first execution is still running, it does **not** call `func` again — instead it blocks and waits for the already-in-flight execution to finish. Once the function completes, **all** waiting callers receive the same result and the key is cleared so future calls with that key will trigger a fresh execution.

- If `func` raises an exception or returns `{:error, reason}`, all waiting callers should receive the error. Specifically: if `func` raises, every caller gets `{:error, {:exception, exception}}` returned. If `func` returns `{:error, reason}`, every caller gets that `{:error, reason}` as-is. If `func` returns `{:ok, value}` or any other non-error term, every caller gets `{:ok, value}` (wrap plain values in `{:ok, value}` if they aren't already an ok-tuple). After either success or failure, the key must be cleared so subsequent calls trigger a new execution.

The GenServer should not execute `func` inside `handle_call` directly — spawn a task or use `Task.async` so the GenServer remains responsive to new callers registering on the same or different keys while a function is running.

Keep track of waiting callers using a list of `GenServer.from()` references so you can reply to all of them when the result arrives.

Give me the complete module in a single file. Use only OTP standard library, no external dependencies.

## Module under test

```elixir
defmodule Dedup do
  @moduledoc """
  A GenServer that deduplicates concurrent identical requests.

  When `execute/3` is called with a key that has no in-flight execution,
  the given function is spawned in a separate task and the caller blocks
  until a result is available.

  If `execute/3` is called with a key that already has an in-flight
  execution, the new caller is queued and will receive the same result
  as all other waiters — without triggering a second execution of `func`.

  Once the task finishes (successfully or not), every waiting caller
  receives the result and the key is cleared, so the next call for that
  key starts a fresh execution.

  ## Result normalisation

  | `func` outcome              | What all callers receive          |
  |-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Returns `{:ok, value}`      | `{:ok, value}`                    |
  | Returns any other term `v`  | `{:ok, v}`                        |
  | Returns `{:error, reason}`  | `{:error, reason}`                |
  | Raises an exception `e`     | `{:error, {:exception, e}}`       |

  ## Example

      {:ok, _pid} = Dedup.start_link(name: MyDedup)

      # Both callers share a single execution of the slow function.
      Task.async(fn -> Dedup.execute(MyDedup, :my_key, fn -> expensive() end) end)
      Task.async(fn -> Dedup.execute(MyDedup, :my_key, fn -> expensive() end) end)
