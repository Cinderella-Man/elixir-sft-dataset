# Document this module

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir module. Its behavior is correct
and must not change — but every piece of documentation has been stripped.

Add the missing documentation and typespecs:

- a `@moduledoc` that explains what the module does and how it is used,
- a `@doc` for every public function,
- a `@spec` for every public function (add `@type`s where they make the
  specs clearer).

Do not change any behavior: every function clause, guard, and expression
must keep working exactly as it does now. Do not rename anything, do not
"improve" the code, and do not add or remove functions. Give me the
complete documented module in a single file.

## The module

```elixir
defmodule Leaderboard do
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Types
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # With :named_table, :ets.new/2 returns the table's name atom, and every
  # operation below addresses the table by that name.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Public API
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  def new(board_name) when is_atom(board_name) do
    board = :ets.new(board_name, [:set, :public, :named_table, read_concurrency: true])
    {:ok, board}
  end

  def submit_score(board, player_id, score) do
    # :ets.update_counter/4 cannot handle floats, so we use a CAS loop instead.
    # insert_new/2 succeeds only when the key is absent — giving us a fast path
    # for first-time submissions with no race conditions.
    case :ets.insert_new(board, {player_id, score}) do
      true ->
        # Fresh insertion — we're done.
        :ok

      false ->
        # Key already exists; update only when the new score is strictly higher.
        # :ets.select_replace/2 performs the conditional overwrite atomically
        # on the ETS level, so no GenServer is needed.
        match_spec = [
          {
            # Match pattern: bind key and score as variables. Embedding the raw
            # player_id in the head would let match-spec-significant atoms
            # (:_, :"$1", …) match as wildcards instead of as themselves — and
            # the contract allows ANY term as a player id.
            {:"$1", :"$2"},
            # Guard: exactly this key (as a literal term) AND a higher score.
            [{:andalso, {:"=:=", :"$1", {:const, player_id}}, {:>, score, :"$2"}}],
            # Action: rebuild the record around the BOUND key variable —
            # select_replace statically requires the key position to be
            # provably unchanged, so :"$1" (not a literal copy) must stay.
            [{{:"$1", {:const, score}}}]
          }
        ]

        :ets.select_replace(board, match_spec)
        :ok
    end
  end

  def top(_board, 0), do: []

  def top(board, n) when is_integer(n) and n > 0 do
    board
    |> :ets.tab2list()
    |> Enum.sort_by(fn {_pid, score} -> score end, :desc)
    |> Enum.take(n)
  end

  def rank(board, player_id) do
    case :ets.lookup(board, player_id) do
      [] ->
        {:error, :not_found}

      [{^player_id, player_score}] ->
        # Count how many players have a score strictly greater than this one.
        # That count + 1 gives us the 1-based standard competition rank.
        match_spec = [
          {
            {:_, :"$1"},
            [{:>, :"$1", player_score}],
            [true]
          }
        ]

        players_above = :ets.select_count(board, match_spec)
        rank = players_above + 1
        {:ok, rank, player_score}
    end
  end
end
