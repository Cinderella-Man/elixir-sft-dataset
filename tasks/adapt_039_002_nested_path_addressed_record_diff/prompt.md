# Migrate existing code to a new spec

Starting point: the working, tested solution below, from a related task.
Change it — no ground-up rewrite — until it satisfies the specification
that follows. On any disagreement between the two (module name, public API,
behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Output
the complete updated code.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule RecordDiff do
  @moduledoc """
  Compares two versions of a record list keyed by a unique ID field and
  produces a structured diff describing what was added, removed, or changed.

  ## Example

      iex> old = [%{id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30}, %{id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 25}]
      iex> new = [%{id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 31}, %{id: 3, name: "Carol", age: 28}]
      iex> RecordDiff.diff(old, new)
      %{
        added:   [%{id: 3, name: "Carol", age: 28}],
        removed: [%{id: 2, name: "Bob",   age: 25}],
        changed: [%{id: 1, changes: %{age: {30, 31}}}]

  @doc """
  Compares `old_list` and `new_list` (both lists of maps) and returns a
  structured diff map.

  ## Options

    * `:key` — the atom key used as the unique record identifier.
      Defaults to `:id`.

  ## Return value

  A map with the following keys:

    * `:added`   — records present in `new_list` but absent in `old_list`.
    * `:removed` — records present in `old_list` but absent in `new_list`.
    * `:changed` — one entry per record that exists in both lists but differs.
      Each entry is a map containing the key field's value and a `:changes`
      sub-map of `%{field => {old_value, new_value}}`.

  Fields that appear in only one version of a record are still reported as
  changes, using the atom `:missing` as a placeholder for the absent value.

## New specification

Hey — could you write me an Elixir module called `NestedRecordDiff`? I need it to compare two versions of a record list keyed by ID and produce a structured diff, but here's the twist: unlike a shallow field-by-field diff, this one has to descend into nested maps and report every change addressed by a dotted path.

For the public API, I'm after these functions:

I want `NestedRecordDiff.diff(old_list, new_list, opts \\ [])`, where both lists are lists of maps (and those maps' values may themselves be maps, nested to arbitrary depth). It should accept a `:key` option — an atom specifying which field to use as the unique identifier — defaulting to `:id`. It should return a map with three keys:
- `:added` — a list of whole records present in `new_list` but not in `old_list`
- `:removed` — a list of whole records present in `old_list` but not in `new_list`
- `:changed` — a list of maps, one per modified record, each containing: the key field's value (e.g. `id: 1`) and a `:changes` map where each key is a dotted path string (e.g. `"address.city"`) locating a changed leaf, and each value is a two-element tuple `{old_value, new_value}`

A few rules I care about for the paths:
- Recurse into a field only when the value is a map in BOTH versions of the record. Two nested maps get compared key-by-key, and their dotted paths are built by joining the atom field names with `"."` (so `%{address: %{city: ...}}` yields paths like `"address.city"`).
- If a field is a map on one side and a scalar (or missing) on the other, do NOT recurse — just report the whole value change at that field's path (e.g. `"address" => {%{...}, "unknown"}`).
- If a leaf field is added or removed between the old and new versions of the same record, treat it as a change: use the atom `:missing` for the absent side (`{:missing, new}` for an added leaf, `{old, :missing}` for a removed one).
- Only report a `:changed` entry for a record whose comparison yields at least one path.

One more thing — the function has to be pure: no processes, no state, no side effects. Please stick to the Elixir standard library only.

Send me the complete module in a single file.
