# Adapt existing code to a new specification

Below is a complete, working, tested Elixir solution to a related task. Do not
start from scratch: treat it as the codebase you have been asked to change.
Modify it to satisfy the new specification that follows — keep whatever carries
over, and change, add, or remove whatever the new specification requires.

Where the existing code and the new specification disagree (module name, public
API, behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Give me
the complete final result.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule RecordDiff do
  @moduledoc """
  Compares two versions of a record list keyed by a unique ID field and
  produces a structured diff describing what was added, removed, or changed.

  ## Example

      iex> old = [%{id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30}, %{id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 25}]
      iex> new = [%{id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 31}, %{id: 3, name: "Carol", age: 28}]
      iex> RecordDiff.diff(old, new)
      %{
        added:   [%{id: 3, name: "Carol", age: 28}],
        removed: [%{id: 2, name: "Bob",   age: 25}],
        changed: [%{id: 1, changes: %{age: {30, 31}}}]
      }

  @doc """
  Compares `old_list` and `new_list` (both lists of maps) and returns a
  structured diff map.

  ## Options

    * `:key` — the atom key used as the unique record identifier.
      Defaults to `:id`.

  ## Return value

  A map with the following keys:

    * `:added`   — records present in `new_list` but absent in `old_list`.
    * `:removed` — records present in `old_list` but absent in `new_list`.
    * `:changed` — one entry per record that exists in both lists but differs.
      Each entry is a map containing the key field's value and a `:changes`
      sub-map of `%{field => {old_value, new_value}}`.

  Fields that appear in only one version of a record are still reported as
  changes, using the atom `:missing` as a placeholder for the absent value.

## New specification

Write me an Elixir module called `NestedRecordDiff` that compares two versions of a record list keyed by ID and produces a structured diff — but unlike a shallow field-by-field diff, this one must descend into **nested maps** and report every change addressed by a dotted path.

I need these functions in the public API:
- `NestedRecordDiff.diff(old_list, new_list, opts \\ [])` where both lists are lists of maps (whose values may themselves be maps, nested to arbitrary depth). It should accept a `:key` option that is an atom specifying which field to use as the unique identifier (defaults to `:id`). It should return a map with three keys:
  - `:added` — a list of whole records present in `new_list` but not in `old_list`
  - `:removed` — a list of whole records present in `old_list` but not in `new_list`
  - `:changed` — a list of maps, one per modified record, each containing: the key field's value (e.g. `id: 1`) and a `:changes` map where each key is a **dotted path string** (e.g. `"address.city"`) locating a changed leaf, and each value is a two-element tuple `{old_value, new_value}`

Path rules:
- Recurse into a field only when the value is a map in BOTH versions of the record. Two nested maps are compared key-by-key, and their dotted paths are built by joining the atom field names with `"."` (so `%{address: %{city: ...}}` yields paths like `"address.city"`).
- If a field is a map on one side and a scalar (or missing) on the other, do NOT recurse — report the whole value change at that field's path (e.g. `"address" => {%{...}, "unknown"}`).
- If a leaf field is added or removed between old and new versions of the same record, treat it as a change: use the atom `:missing` for the absent side (`{:missing, new}` for an added leaf, `{old, :missing}` for a removed one).
- Only report a `:changed` entry for a record whose comparison yields at least one path.

The function must be pure — no processes, no state, no side effects. Use only the Elixir standard library.

Give me the complete module in a single file.
