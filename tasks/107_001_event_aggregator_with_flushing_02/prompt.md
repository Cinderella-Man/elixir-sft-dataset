# Fill in the middle: implement `flush/1`

This is the `Aggregator` GenServer — a process that buffers pushed events and
delivers them to an `:on_flush` callback in batches, triggered either by batch
size or by an elapsed interval. Every other function in the module is already
written. Your job is to implement the private `flush/1` helper.

## What `flush/1` must do

`flush/1` takes the GenServer `state` and delivers the currently buffered events
to the `on_flush` callback, then resets the buffer. Specifically:

- If the buffer is empty (`count` is `0`), it must **not** call the callback and
  must return the state unchanged — there are no empty flushes.
- Otherwise, produce the batch by reversing `state.buffer` into push order (the
  buffer is stored reversed for O(1) prepend), and call `state.on_flush.(batch)`
  with that list.
- After delivering the batch, reset the interval timer via `clear_timer/1` (a
  flush always resets the timer, for either trigger reason) and empty the buffer
  by setting `buffer` to `[]` and `count` to `0`.
- Return the updated state.

Implement it using the `clear_timer/1` helper and the existing state shape.

```elixir
defmodule Aggregator do
  @moduledoc """
  A `GenServer` that collects individual events and flushes them to a
  callback in batches.

  A flush is triggered when **either** of the following happens first:

    * the number of buffered events reaches `:batch_size`, or
    * `:interval_ms` milliseconds elapse since the last flush (or since
      start) while there are buffered events.

  The interval is anchored on the most recent flush (or on start, if no
  flush has happened yet) — not on the moment an event is pushed. Events
  are always delivered to the `:on_flush` callback as a list, in the exact
  order they were pushed.

  Start an aggregator process.

  ## Options

    * `:batch_size` — positive integer, flush once this many events are
      buffered. Defaults to `#{@default_batch_size}`.
    * `:interval_ms` — positive integer number of milliseconds after which a
      non-empty buffer is flushed. Defaults to `#{@default_interval_ms}`.
    * `:on_flush` — one-arity function called with the batch (a list) on each
      flush. Defaults to a no-op.
    * `:name` — optional registration name, passed to `GenServer.start_link/3`.
