  Start and link an `LRUCache` process.

  ## Options

  * `:name` (required) – atom used to register the process *and* to derive the
    names of the two backing ETS tables (`<name>_data` and `<name>_order`).
  * `:max_size` (required) – maximum number of entries the cache may hold.
    Must be a positive integer.

  The freshly started cache is empty and its timestamp counter is `0`, so the
  first entry it stores carries timestamp `1`.
