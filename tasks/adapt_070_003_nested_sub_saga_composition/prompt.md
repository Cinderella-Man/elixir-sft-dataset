# Migrate existing code to a new spec

Starting point: the working, tested solution below, from a related task.
Change it — no ground-up rewrite — until it satisfies the specification
that follows. On any disagreement between the two (module name, public API,
behavior, constraints, output format), the new specification wins. Output
the complete updated code.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule Saga do
  @moduledoc """
  Implements the Saga pattern for coordinating distributed transactions
  with automatic compensation on failure.

  ## Overview

  A saga is a sequence of named steps. Each step pairs a fallible
  *action* with an infallible *compensating action*. When any action
  fails, every action that already succeeded is compensated in reverse
  order, ensuring the system can be returned to a consistent state.

  ## Context threading

  Every action and compensating function receives the *accumulated*
  context map — the initial context merged with all results produced
  by steps that have run so far. A successful action's result is
  stored under the step's name:

      %{initial_key: value, reserve: reserve_result, charge: charge_result}

  Compensating functions receive the full context at the exact moment
  execution failed, so they have access to all data produced up to
  that point.

  ## Example

      saga =
        Saga.new()
        |> Saga.step(:reserve, &reserve_inventory/1, &release_inventory/1)
        |> Saga.step(:charge,  &charge_payment/1,   &refund_payment/1)
        |> Saga.step(:ship,    &create_shipment/1,   &cancel_shipment/1)

      case Saga.execute(saga, %{order_id: 42}) do
        {:ok, ctx} ->
          IO.inspect(ctx.ship, label: "shipment")

        {:error, failed_step, reason, compensations} ->
          IO.puts("Failed at \#{failed_step}: \#{inspect(reason)}")
          IO.inspect(compensations, label: "compensation results")
      end

  Appends a named step to the saga.

  ## Parameters

    * `saga`          – the saga to extend.
    * `name`          – an atom that uniquely identifies the step. The
                        step's result will be stored in the context under
                        this key.
    * `action_fn`     – `(context -> {:ok, result} | {:error, reason})`.
                        Receives the current accumulated context.
    * `compensate_fn` – `(context -> any)`. Receives the context at the
                        point of failure. Its return value is recorded but
                        never causes a failure; any exception is caught and
                        recorded instead.

  Steps are executed in the order they are added.

  Executes the saga against an initial `context` map.

  Steps run strictly in the order they were added. Each successful
  step merges its result into the context under the step's name before
  the next step begins.

  On failure the compensating functions for all *completed* steps run
  in **reverse order**. Failures (or exceptions) inside a compensating
  function are caught, recorded, and never abort the remaining
  compensations.

  ## Return values

    * `{:ok, final_context}` — all steps succeeded.
    * `{:error, failed_step_name, reason, compensation_results}` — the
      step named `failed_step_name` returned `{:error, reason}`. The
      `compensation_results` keyword list contains one entry per
      compensated step, in reverse execution order.

## New specification

Write me an Elixir module called `Saga` that implements the Saga pattern **with composable, nested sub-sagas**. A saga step can be either a plain leaf action or an entire embedded sub-saga, forming a tree. Compensation must unwind that tree correctly.

Public API:
- `Saga.new()` — creates a new, empty saga struct.
- `Saga.step(saga, name, action_fn, compensate_fn)` — appends a **leaf** step. `action_fn` receives the accumulated context and returns `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}`; on success the result is merged into the context under `name`. `compensate_fn` receives the accumulated context as it stands when compensation runs (including the results of steps that completed before the failure) and its return value is recorded but never fails the chain.
- `Saga.nest(saga, name, sub_saga)` — appends a **nested** step whose behaviour is another `Saga` value. When executed, the sub-saga runs against the current accumulated context; on success its final context is merged into the outer context under `name`.
- `Saga.execute(saga, context)` — runs the steps in order.

Return values:
- `{:ok, final_context}` on full success.
- `{:error, failed_path, reason, compensation_results}` on failure, where:
  - `failed_path` is a list of step names from the outermost saga down to the leaf that actually failed (e.g. `[:child, :y]` when leaf `:y` failed inside nested step `:child`; a top-level leaf failure yields `[:name]`).
  - `compensation_results` is a keyword list `[step_name: value]` in reverse call order.

Failure & compensation semantics:
- When a leaf fails, forward execution stops and previously completed steps of the **current** saga are compensated in reverse order.
- When a **nested** sub-saga fails, it first compensates its own completed inner steps (in reverse), then the failure propagates to the outer saga, which compensates its previously completed steps. The returned `compensation_results` lists the failed nested step's inner compensation results first, as `{nested_name, inner_keyword_list}`, followed by the outer steps in reverse order.
- When compensation reaches a previously **fully-succeeded** nested step, every inner step is compensated in reverse, and its entry in the keyword list is `{nested_name, inner_keyword_list}` (itself in reverse order). Nesting is arbitrarily deep.
- A raising compensating function must not abort the remaining compensations; catch and record it.

Plain module with a struct — no GenServer, no processes, no external dependencies. Give me the complete implementation in a single file.

## Additional interface contract

- When a compensating function raises, the value recorded for that step in `compensation_results` is `{:exception, exception, stacktrace}` — a 3-tuple carrying the raised exception struct and the stacktrace it was caught with.
