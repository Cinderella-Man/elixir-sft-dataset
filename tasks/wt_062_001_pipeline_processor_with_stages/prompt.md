# Write tests for this module

Below is a completed Elixir module and the original specification it was built to
satisfy. Write a comprehensive ExUnit test harness that verifies a correct
implementation of this module.

Requirements for the harness:
- Define a module `<Module>Test` that does `use ExUnit.Case, async: false`.
- Do NOT call `ExUnit.start()` — the evaluator starts ExUnit itself.
- Make it self-contained: any fakes, clock Agents, or helpers are defined inline.
- Cover the full public API and the important edge cases described in the spec.
- It must compile with ZERO warnings (prefix unused variables with `_`; match float
  zero as `+0.0`/`-0.0`).
- Give me the complete harness in a single file.

## Original specification

Write me an Elixir module called `Pipeline` that lets callers build and run linear processing pipelines from composable stages.

I need these functions in the public API:
- `Pipeline.new()` — returns a fresh, empty pipeline struct.
- `Pipeline.stage(pipeline, name, fun)` — appends a named stage to the pipeline and returns a new pipeline, leaving the original unchanged so a base pipeline can be branched and reused. `name` is an atom, `fun` is a one-arity function that receives the current value and returns either `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}`. Guard the arguments so that a non-atom `name` or a function of the wrong arity raises `FunctionClauseError`. Stages must be stored in insertion order (duplicate names are allowed and each occurrence runs).
- `Pipeline.run(pipeline, input)` — executes all stages in order, threading the result of each stage as the input to the next. If every stage succeeds, return `{:ok, final_result, metadata}` where `metadata` is a list of `%{stage: atom, duration_us: non_neg_integer}` entries in execution order. A pipeline with no stages returns `{:ok, input, []}`. If any stage returns `{:error, reason}`, immediately halt and return `{:error, failed_stage_name, reason}` — do not execute any subsequent stages, and return `reason` verbatim regardless of its shape.

Timing per stage must be measured with `:timer.tc/1` (or equivalent microsecond-resolution call); each metadata entry's `duration_us` is a non-negative integer. Metadata is returned only in the success tuple — the `{:error, failed_stage_name, reason}` halt result carries no metadata list.

The module must be pure — no processes, no GenServer, no global state. It should be a plain Elixir module whose stages run entirely in the caller's process, so repeated runs of the same pipeline are independent.

Give me the complete implementation in a single file. Use only the standard library, no external dependencies.

## Module under test

```elixir
defmodule Pipeline do
  @moduledoc """
  Composable linear processing pipelines.

  Stages are executed in insertion order, each receiving the previous stage's
  result as input. Timing metadata (in microseconds) is collected for every
  stage that actually runs.

  ## Example

      iex> Pipeline.new()
      ...> |> Pipeline.stage(:parse,    fn s -> {:ok, String.to_integer(s)} end)
      ...> |> Pipeline.stage(:double,   fn n -> {:ok, n * 2} end)
      ...> |> Pipeline.stage(:to_str,   fn n -> {:ok, Integer.to_string(n)} end)
      ...> |> Pipeline.run("21")
      {:ok, "42", [
        %{stage: :parse,   duration_us: ...},
        %{stage: :double,  duration_us: ...},
        %{stage: :to_str,  duration_us: ...}
      ]}
