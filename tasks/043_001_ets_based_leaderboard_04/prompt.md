Implement the public `top/2` function for the `Leaderboard` module.

`top(board, n)` retrieves the top `n` players from the leaderboard, sorted by
score in descending order. Each element of the returned list is a
`{player_id, score}` tuple.

Requirements:
- When `n` is `0`, return an empty list immediately (a dedicated clause handles
  this case).
- For a positive integer `n`, read every entry out of the backing ETS table
  (e.g. with `:ets.tab2list/1`), sort the entries by score descending, and take
  the first `n`.
- If the leaderboard contains fewer than `n` players, return all of them.
- Ties in score may be returned in any order.

Implement the two clauses of `top/2` (the `top(_board, 0)` base case and the
`top(board, n)` general case). Every other function in the module is already
complete.

```elixir
defmodule Leaderboard do
  @moduledoc """
  A leaderboard backed by an ETS table.

  ## Tie-breaking / Rank contract

  `rank/2` uses **standard competition ranking** ("1224" ranking): all players
  with the same score receive the same rank, and the next rank is bumped by the
  full size of the tied group.  For example, if two players share rank 1, the
  next player is rank 3.  The ordering among players with an identical score is
  unspecified and may change between calls.
