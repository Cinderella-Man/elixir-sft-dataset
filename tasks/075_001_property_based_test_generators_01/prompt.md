# Ticket: `Generators` — reusable `StreamData` generators for domain models

**Summary:** Implement an Elixir module `Generators` exposing reusable `StreamData` generators for common domain models, for property-based testing with the `StreamData` and `ExUnitProperties` libraries.

**Public API — required functions**
- `Generators.user/0`
- `Generators.money/0`
- `Generators.date_range/0`
- `Generators.non_empty_list/1`
- `Generators.one_of_weighted/1`

**Global constraints**
- Every one of these must return a `%StreamData{}` struct, so it composes with the standard `StreamData` combinator API (`StreamData.map/2`, `StreamData.bind/2`, `StreamData.list_of/2`, `StreamData.filter/2`, …) and works directly inside `check all` clauses.
- All constraints must be enforced *structurally*, inside the generator. A consumer must never need to filter, reject, or re-roll a generated value to satisfy the documented contract.
- No generator may rely on rejection sampling internally either.

**`Generators.user/0` — shape**
- Produces maps with exactly these five keys and no others: `:id`, `:name`, `:email`, `:age`, `:role`.
- `:id` — positive integer (`>= 1`; zero and negatives never occur).
- `:name` — non-empty string, letters only.
- `:email` — string of the form `"<local>@<domain>.<tld>"`.
- `:age` — integer, `18..120` inclusive.
- `:role` — exactly one of `:admin`, `:editor`, `:viewer`.

**`Generators.user/0` — `:name` details**
- Between 1 and 50 characters inclusive.
- Every character is an ASCII letter, either lowercase `a`–`z` or uppercase `A`–`Z`. Mixed case within one name is allowed.
- No digits, whitespace, punctuation, or non-ASCII characters ever appear.
- The empty string never occurs, and a name longer than 50 characters never occurs.

**`Generators.user/0` — `:email` details**
- Contains exactly one `@`. The `local` part is everything before the `@`; `domain` and `tld` are the parts before and after the single `.` that follows the `@`.
- Each of the three segments is between 1 and 20 characters inclusive and drawn only from lowercase `a`–`z` and digits `0`–`9`.
- No segment is ever empty, so the email never starts with `@`, never has an empty domain, and never ends with `.`.
- Uppercase letters never appear in an email.
- The three segments are drawn independently of each other and of `:name`.

**`Generators.user/0` — reachable boundaries**
- `:age` can be exactly `18` and exactly `120`.
- `:name` can be exactly 1 character and exactly 50.
- Each email segment can be exactly 1 character and exactly 20.

**`Generators.money/0`**
- Produces `%{amount: amount, currency: currency}` maps with exactly those two keys.
- `amount` is an integer in `0..10_000_000` inclusive, representing cents. Negative amounts never occur; `0` and `10_000_000` are both reachable.
- `currency` is one of the strings `"USD"`, `"EUR"`, `"GBP"`, `"JPY"`, `"CHF"` — nothing else.
- The two fields are drawn independently: any currency can pair with any amount.

**`Generators.date_range/0`**
- Produces `%{start_date: start_date, end_date: end_date}` maps with exactly those two keys.
- Both values are `Date` structs.
- Both fall within the inclusive bounds `~D[2000-01-01]` and `~D[2100-12-31]`. Both endpoints of that window are reachable, and no date outside it is ever produced.
- The range is inclusive and never inverted: `Date.compare(start_date, end_date)` is always `:lt` or `:eq`, never `:gt`. Enforce structurally — pick the start first, then draw the end from the days at or after the start (up to the upper bound) — not by filtering out inverted pairs.
- Both same-day ranges (`start_date == end_date`) and multi-day ranges (`start_date < end_date`) must occur with non-negligible frequency: a sample of a few hundred generated values should reliably contain a healthy number of each. Do not lean on the incidental bias of a wide integer range happening to land on its lower bound — make the same-day case an explicit alternative that is chosen a substantial fraction of the time.
- Note: when `start_date` is exactly `~D[2100-12-31]`, the only possible `end_date` is that same day, so the map is a same-day range.

**`Generators.non_empty_list/1`**
- `non_empty_list(generator)` is a combinator over *any* `StreamData` generator — one of the ones above, a plain `StreamData` generator, or another composed generator.
- Produces lists whose length is between 1 and 20 inclusive. The empty list is never produced, and a list of 21+ elements is never produced. Both boundary lengths (1 and 20) are reachable.
- The length is chosen first and the list then has exactly that many elements; list length does not silently track `StreamData`'s size parameter.
- Every element is a value the wrapped generator could itself have produced, so `non_empty_list(Generators.user())` yields a list of valid user maps, `non_empty_list(StreamData.integer())` yields a list of integers, and so on.
- Elements are drawn independently — duplicates within one list are allowed and expected.

**`Generators.one_of_weighted/1` — behavior**
- `one_of_weighted(weighted_list)` takes a list of `{weight, generator}` tuples and produces values drawn from those generators in proportion to their weights.
- Weights are non-negative integers. A generator with weight `w` is selected with probability `w / sum_of_all_weights`; e.g. `[{10, gen_a}, {1, gen_b}]` yields values from `gen_a` roughly ten times as often as from `gen_b`.
- Proportions need only hold statistically — over a sample of a few hundred values the observed split should clearly track the weights, not match them exactly.
- A weight of `0` means that generator is **never** selected: it contributes nothing to the total weight and none of its values ever appear in the output.
- The generators themselves may be arbitrary — including the other generators in this module — and the values they emit are unchanged by this combinator; it only decides which one to draw from.
- Shrinking must still flow through the chosen underlying generator, so a failing property shrinks toward that generator's own minimal values rather than getting stuck.

**`Generators.one_of_weighted/1` — caller errors**
- The argument must be a non-empty list.
- Calling it with `[]`, with a non-list, or with a tuple whose weight is not a non-negative integer is a caller error and may raise (a `FunctionClauseError` is fine).
- There is no `{:error, …}` return value anywhere in this module's API.
- A list in which *every* weight is `0` leaves nothing to select from and is allowed to raise; no special-casing with a friendly message required.

**Deliverable**
- The complete module in a single file.
- `@doc`/`@moduledoc` documentation and `@spec`s on the public functions.
- Use only `stream_data` as an external dependency, no others.
