# Rework this solution for a changed brief

The module below is a complete, tested solution to a neighboring task. Treat
it as your starting codebase, not as a suggestion — carry over what still
fits and rewrite what the new brief demands. Where old code and the new
specification conflict (module name, public API, behavior, constraints,
output format), the new specification is authoritative. Return the complete
final result.

## Existing code (your starting point)

```elixir
defmodule Pipeline do
  @moduledoc """
  Composable linear processing pipelines.

  Stages are executed in insertion order, each receiving the previous stage's
  result as input. Timing metadata (in microseconds) is collected for every
  stage that actually runs.

  ## Example

      iex> Pipeline.new()
      ...> |> Pipeline.stage(:parse,    fn s -> {:ok, String.to_integer(s)} end)
      ...> |> Pipeline.stage(:double,   fn n -> {:ok, n * 2} end)
      ...> |> Pipeline.stage(:to_str,   fn n -> {:ok, Integer.to_string(n)} end)
      ...> |> Pipeline.run("21")
      {:ok, "42", [
        %{stage: :parse,   duration_us: ...},

## New specification

# Specification — `Pipeline`: Composable Linear Pipelines with Fan-Out Map Stages

## Overview

This document specifies an Elixir module called `Pipeline` that builds and runs linear processing pipelines from composable stages, with support for **fan-out map stages** that process a collection concurrently.

The implementation must use only the standard library, with no external dependencies. The complete implementation is to be delivered in a single file.

## API

The public API consists of the following functions.

### `Pipeline.new()`

Returns a fresh, empty pipeline struct.

### `Pipeline.stage(pipeline, name, fun)`

Appends a normal **sequential** stage. `name` is an atom; `fun` is a one-arity function that receives the current value and returns `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}`.

### `Pipeline.map_stage(pipeline, name, fun, opts \\ [])`

Appends a **fan-out** stage. Its input must be a list. `fun` is a one-arity function applied to **each element** concurrently, returning `{:ok, element_result}` or `{:error, reason}`. `opts` may contain `:max_concurrency` (a positive integer); when omitted, there is no concurrency bound — **every** element runs concurrently at once.

Element results must be collected in **input order**. If every element succeeds, the stage's output is the list of element results (threaded to the next stage). If any element fails, the stage fails with the **first** failure by input index, and the `reason` is that element's `{:error, reason}` reason.

### `Pipeline.run(pipeline, input)`

Executes all stages in insertion order, threading each stage's output into the next.

On full success it returns `{:ok, final_result, metadata}`, where `metadata` is a list of entries in execution order:

- sequential stage: `%{stage: atom, duration_us: non_neg_integer, type: :sequential, count: 1}`
- map stage: `%{stage: atom, duration_us: non_neg_integer, type: :map, count: non_neg_integer}` where `count` is the number of input elements.

On the first failing stage, execution halts immediately and the call returns `{:error, failed_stage_name, reason}` — no later stages are run.

## Implementation constraints

- Fan-out concurrency must use `Task.async_stream/3` (or equivalent) with ordered results and the requested `:max_concurrency`.
- Timing per stage must be measured with `:timer.tc/1` (microsecond resolution).

## Edge cases

- An empty pipeline returns the input unchanged with empty metadata.
- If a map stage receives a non-list input, it raises `ArgumentError`.
- When a map stage has multiple failing elements, the failure reported is the **first** one by input index.
- When `:max_concurrency` is omitted from `opts`, the map stage imposes no concurrency bound and every element runs concurrently at once.
