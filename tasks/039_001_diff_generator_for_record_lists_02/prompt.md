Implement the private `diff_records/2` function. It receives two versions of the
same record — `old_record` and `new_record` — both maps, and returns a map of the
form `%{field => {old_value, new_value}}` containing one entry for every field
whose value differs between the two versions.

Consider the union of all field names present in either record (deduplicated).
For each field, look up its value in the old record and in the new record, using
the atom `:missing` as the placeholder when a field is absent from that version.
If the two values are equal, omit the field from the result; otherwise record it
as `field => {old_value, new_value}`. A field that exists in only one version is
therefore reported as a change, with `:missing` on the side where it is absent.
If the two records are identical, return an empty map.

```elixir
defmodule RecordDiff do
  @moduledoc """
  Compares two versions of a record list keyed by a unique ID field and
  produces a structured diff describing what was added, removed, or changed.

  ## Example

      iex> old = [%{id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30}, %{id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 25}]
      iex> new = [%{id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 31}, %{id: 3, name: "Carol", age: 28}]
      iex> RecordDiff.diff(old, new)
      %{
        added:   [%{id: 3, name: "Carol", age: 28}],
        removed: [%{id: 2, name: "Bob",   age: 25}],
        changed: [%{id: 1, changes: %{age: {30, 31}}}]
      }

  @doc """
  Compares `old_list` and `new_list` (both lists of maps) and returns a
  structured diff map.

  ## Options

    * `:key` — the atom key used as the unique record identifier.
      Defaults to `:id`.

  ## Return value

  A map with the following keys:

    * `:added`   — records present in `new_list` but absent in `old_list`.
    * `:removed` — records present in `old_list` but absent in `new_list`.
    * `:changed` — one entry per record that exists in both lists but differs.
      Each entry is a map containing the key field's value and a `:changes`
      sub-map of `%{field => {old_value, new_value}}`.

  Fields that appear in only one version of a record are still reported as
  changes, using the atom `:missing` as a placeholder for the absent value.
